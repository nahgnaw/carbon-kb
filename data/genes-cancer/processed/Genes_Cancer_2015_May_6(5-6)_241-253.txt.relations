INTRODUCTION

Major executioners of programmed cell death by apoptosis are relatively well conserved throughout evolution.
('executioners of cell death', 'are conserved throughout', 'evolution')

However, the control of commitment to apoptosis exhibits some differences between organisms.
('control of commitment to apoptosis', 'exhibits', 'differences between organisms')

During mammalian cells apoptosis, various key pro-apoptotic factors are released from the inter-membrane space of mitochondria (for review, see []).
('factors', 'are released from', 'space of mitochondria')

These factors include cytochrome c, Apoptosis Inducing Factor (AIF), Endonuclease G, Smac/DIABLO (Second mitochondria-derived activator of caspase/direct IAP-binding protein with low PI) and the serine protease Omi/HtrA2.
('factors', 'include', 'cytochrome c')

Once released in the cytosol, cytochrome c binds to the WD40 domain of Apaf-1 and leads to the formation of a cytochrome c/Apaf-1/caspase-9 complex called “apoptosome”, in which caspase-9 (a cysteinyl aspartase) auto-activates to initiate a caspase activation cascade that will lead to cell death.
('cytochrome c', 'binds to', 'WD40 domain complex called')
('cytochrome c', 'leads to', 'formation of cytochrome c/Apaf')

Mitochondrial permeabilization is under the control of the Bcl-2 family of proteins.
('permeabilization', 'is under', 'control of family of proteins')

These proteins share one to four homology domains with Bcl-2 (named BH1-4) and exhibit very similar tertiary structures.
('proteins', 'share', 'homology domains')
('proteins', 'exhibit', 'structures')

However, while some of these proteins (such as Bcl-2) are anti-apoptotic, the others are pro-apoptotic and assigned to one of the following sub-classes: BH3-only proteins (such as Bid) and multi-domain proteins (such as Bax).

During apoptosis, Bax translocates to the mitochondrial outer membrane, undergoes conformational changes, oligomerizes and finally allows the release of pro-apoptotic factors from the intermembrane space (review []).
('Bax', 'translocates to', 'membrane')

Anti-apoptotic proteins of the Bcl-2 family oppose this Bax-mediated mitochondrial release of apoptogenic factors while BH3-only proteins can activate Bax or inhibit anti-apoptotic proteins of the family.
('proteins of family', 'oppose', 'release of factors')
('proteins', 'can activate', 'Bax')
('proteins', 'inhibit', 'proteins of family')

In C. elegans, activation of the caspase CED-3 requires CED-4, the homologue of Apaf-1 but no cytochrome c.

The Bcl-2 family protein CED-9 constitutively interacts with CED-4 and thereby prevents the activation CED-3.

This repression of cell death is released upon binding of CED-9 to the BH3-only protein EGL-1, which induces a conformational change in CED-9 that results in the dissociation of the CED-4 dimer from CED-9.
('repression of cell death', 'is released upon', 'binding')

Released CED-4 dimers form tetramers, which facilitate auto-activation of CED-3 [].
('dimers', 'form', 'tetramers')

Although CED-9 appears bound to mitochondria, these organelles seem to play a minor role in apoptosis in C. elegans, contrarily to mammals [].
('organelles', 'seem to play', 'role')

The role of mitochondria in Drosophila programmed cell death remains more elusive [, -].
('role of mitochondria', 'remains', 'elusive')

Cytochrome c does not seem crucial in the apoptosome activation [, ], which is mediated by the degradation of the caspase inhibitor DIAP1 by proteins of the Reaper/Hid/Grim (RHG) family.
('Cytochrome c', 'does not seem', 'crucial')

The apoptotic cascade appears somehow inverted between flies and worm/mammals.
('cascade', 'appears', 'inverted between flies')

In these two last organisms, apoptosis regulators are relocated from mitochondria to the cytosol.
('apoptosis regulators', 'are relocated from', 'mitochondria')

Contrarily, Drosophila apoptosis regulators are concentrated at or around mitochondria during apoptosis.
('Drosophila apoptosis regulators', 'are concentrated at', 'mitochondria')

Indeed, targeting the RHG proteins Reaper (Rpr) and Grim to mitochondria seems to be required for their pro-apoptotic activity [-].

Furthermore, Hid possesses a mitochondrial targeting sequence and is required for Rpr recruitment to the mitochondrial membrane and for efficient induction of cell death in vivo [].
('Hid', 'possesses', 'targeting sequence')
('Hid', 'is required for', 'Rpr recruitment to membrane')

The important role played in Drosophila by the mitochondria in apoptosis is also suggested by the mitochondrial subcellular localization of Buffy and Debcl, the only two members of the Bcl-2 family identified, so far, in this organism.
('role played in Drosophila', 'is suggested by', 'localization of Buffy')

Buffy was originally described as an anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family member [, ], but it can also promote cell death [-].
('Buffy', 'was described as', 'family member')

Debcl (death executioner Bcl 2 homolog), is a multidomain death inducer [-] that can be inhibited by direct physical interaction with Buffy [].
('Debcl', 'is', 'death inducer')

When overexpressed in mammalian cells, debcl induces both cytochrome c release from mitochondria and apoptosis.
('debcl', 'induces', 'cytochrome c release from mitochondria')

This protein interacts physically with anti-apoptotic members of the Bcl-2 family, such as Bcl-2 itself, in mammals.

In Drosophila, Debcl is involved in the control of some developmental cell death processes as well as in irradiation-induced apoptosis [, , ].
('Debcl', 'is involved in', 'control of cell death processes')

We have previously shown in Drosophila that mammalian Bcl-2 inhibits developmental and irradiation-induced cell death [] as well as rpr- and bax-induced mitochondrial membrane potential collapse [].

Interestingly, we have shown that bax-induced cell death is mitigated by loss-of-function (LOF) mutations in genes encoding some components of the TOM complex which controls protein insertion in the outer mitochondrial membrane [].
('cell death', 'is mitigated by', 'mutations in genes encoding components of TOM complex')

These results suggest that Bax mitochondrial location remains important for its activity in Drosophila.
('Bax location', 'remains', 'important for activity in Drosophila')

Therefore, flies provide a good animal model system to study Bax-induced cell death in a simple genetic background and look for new regulators of Bcl-2 family members.

Here, we report the results of the screening of P[UAS]-element insertion (UYi) library, performed in order to identify modifiers of bax-induced phenotypes in Drosophila.

Among 1475 UYi lines screened, 17 putative modifiers were isolated, that include genes involved in various cellular functions.

We also present a more detailed study of one of these modifiers, UY1039, and show that glycerophosphate oxidase-1 (Gpo-1) [EC 1.1.5.3] participates in debcl-induced apoptosis by increasing reactive oxygen species (ROS) production.

RESULTS

A modifier screen for suppressors of bax-induced phenotypes

We have previously shown that expression of the proapoptotic gene bax induced apoptosis in the developing eye or wing [, ].
('expression of gene bax', 'induced', 'apoptosis')

Expression of bax under control of the wing specific vg-GAL4 driver during development led to lethality and notches in the wing of the surviving escapers.
('Expression of bax', 'led to', 'lethality')

As expected from the temperature sensitivity of the UAS-GAL4 expression system, lethality was more penetrant and wing phenotypes were more severe when flies were raised at 25°C than at 18°C.
('flies', 'were raised at', 'C')

This adult wing phenotype was suppressed by bcl-2 expression [, ] and by heterozygosity for LOF mutations in genes encoding Tom22 or Tom70 [], indicating that the vg&gt;bax-induced adult wing phenotype is sensitive and thus amenable to genetic screening.
('wing phenotype', 'was suppressed by', 'expression')

To gain insight into the molecular mechanism of bax-induced apoptosis and with the aim of isolating regulators of this process, we designed a genetic screen for modifiers of Bax-mediated tissue loss in the wing.

To ease the screening procedure, we used a strain recombined for vg-GAL4 and UAS-bax transgenes.

Animals heterozygous for vg&gt;bax showed a strong and scorable notched wing phenotype (Figure , compared to ), facilitating the selection of suppressors rather than enhancers.

A mutagenesis involving the transposition of a P-element containing UAS sequences, P[Mae-UAS.6.11] has been performed.

Genes flanking the 5′ end of the transposon could therefore be transcriptionally regulated by the UAS/GAL4 system and thus overexpressed.
("Genes flanking ' end of transposon", 'could be regulated by', 'UAS/GAL4 system')

The P-element insertion, per se, could also generate LOF mutations.
('insertion', 'could generate', 'LOF mutations')

As part of a consortium of laboratories, we have produced Drosophila lines with random insertion sites of the P-element named hereafter UYi [-].

Thus, a collection of 1475 lines, i.e. 594 with the P-element inserted on the second chromosome, 775 on the third chromosome and 106 on the X chromosome was generated.

Males carrying UYi were crossed with vg&gt;bax/CyOGFP females and their progeny were screened for a rescue of both lethality (at 18°C and/or 25°C) and the notch phenotype (see Materials and Methods).
('Males carrying UYi', 'were crossed with', 'vg bax/CyOGFP females')

Examples of wing phenotypes suppression are shown on Figure . 56 UYi lines were selected, corresponding to 3,8% of the collection (56/1475).
('Examples of wing phenotypes suppression', 'are shown on', 'Figure')

Since the number of flies exhibiting a rescue of the wing phenotype was sometimes low, we tested the relevance of the suppression of the wing phenotype by a statistical approach.

As previously described [], expressivity and penetrance of the wing phenotype are variable in a population of flies of the same genotype.
('expressivity', 'are variable in', 'population of flies of genotype')
('penetrance', 'are variable in', 'population of flies of genotype')

Flies expressing bax in the wing exhibit a distribution of phenotypes that can be classified into three categories: strong, intermediate and weak according to the number and size of notches observed along the wing margin.
('Flies', 'exhibit', 'distribution of phenotypes')

Therefore, we have used the statistical Wilcoxon test [] to compare distributions of phenotypes between the two different types of progenies that express bax with or without the UYi suppressor.

This test defines an α and a Ws value that respectively allow assessment of whether two distributions are significantly different or not, and which population is composed of stronger phenotypes.
('test', 'defines', 'a Ws value')
('distributions', 'is composed of', 'phenotypes')
('population', 'is composed of', 'phenotypes')

We defined the statistically significant limit as α&lt;10−3.

Using this stringent criterion, we identified 24 suppressors of bax acting both on fly survival and wing phenotype, among the 56 selected UYi lines, corresponding to 1.6% of the collection (24/1475).
('bax', 'acting', 'both on fly survival')

Subsequently, to distinguish possible additive effects from more specific interactions, all selected UYi lines were crossed with vg-GAL4.

Only wild type wing phenotypes were observed, ruling out an additive effect of UYi and bax transgenes, and thus revealing the specificity of the genetic interactions between bax and the 24 insertions.
('type wing phenotypes', 'were observed ruling', 'effect of UYi transgenes')
('type wing phenotypes', 'revealing', 'specificity of interactions between bax')

To define if the wing phenotype suppression could be due to a gain of function (GOF) or a LOF, we identified the insertion point and orientation of each of the 24 insertions.
('wing phenotype suppression', 'could be due to', 'gain of function')

PCR rescue experiments were performed and their products were sequenced.

We compared the recovered sequence of the flanking genomic DNA to the Drosophila full-genome sequence database [].

We were unable to obtain unambiguous flanking sequence information for 7 isolated UYi lines, i.e. UY504, UY1220, UY1236, UY1649, UY2303, UY2650 and UY2803.

Therefore, 17 putative suppressors of bax-induced apoptosis were identified.

The results obtained during the screen of these bax-induced phenotypes are presented in table . Table  summarizes the genetic and molecular characterization of the selected insertions.
('results obtained during screen of phenotypes', 'are presented in', 'table')

Identified suppressors of bax-induced lethality and wing phenotypes

The chromosomal location, the increase in survival rate at 18°C or 25°C as compared to vg&gt;bax flies (NS: not significant) and the statistical result of the wing phenotype suppression are presented for each of the 17 identified suppressors.
('location', 'are presented for', 'each of suppressors')

They are involved in cell growth, proliferation or death, pathfinding and cell adhesion, secretion and extracellular signaling, metabolism and oxidative stress, ubiquitin/proteasome pathway.

Moreover, only few data are reported concerning Debcl regulation and its partners.
('data', 'are reported concerning', 'regulation partners')

Therefore, we decided to test if the identified modifiers of bax-induced cell death could also genetically interact with debcl.
('modifiers of cell death', 'could interact with', 'debcl')

As for bax-induced cell death, the expression of debcl in wing imaginal discs during development induces apoptosis, which leads to a wing phenotype [].
('expression of debcl', 'induces', 'apoptosis')

A very homogenous adult phenotype was obtained when expressing debcl along the antero-posterior frontier of wing discs, thanks to ptc-GAL4 driver [].

Under these conditions, debcl expression brought closer L3 and L4 veins in the proximal region of the wing, inducing a fusion of these veins in the region of the anterior cross vein (figure ).
('debcl expression', 'brought', 'L3 L4 veins')

These phenotypes were due to an excess of apoptosis [].
('phenotypes', 'were due to', 'excess of apoptosis')

Before testing genetic interactions, all selected UYi insertion were crossed with ptc-GAL4 flies, to verify that their own overexpression did not give rise to any wing phenotype.
('overexpression', 'did not give', 'rise')
('UYi insertion', 'were crossed with', 'flies')

All lines studied showed a wild type wing phenotype when tested with ptc-GAL4.
('lines studied', 'showed', 'type wing phenotype')

An exception was UY2669 that exhibited an absence of anterior cross vein but no alteration at the level of the antero-posterior frontier.
('that', 'exhibited', 'absence of cross vein')

This secondary screen was performed on 15 insertions because two lines were lost (UY1116 and UY1039).
('screen', 'was performed on', 'insertions')

We found nine suppressors of debcl-induced phenotype (Table ).

An example is shown in Figure  for UY2669.
('example', 'is shown in', 'Figure for UY2669')

Four of Bax modifiers had no significant effect and two led to complex phenotypes of partial penetrance as shown for UY2111 in Figure . Thus, most of bax-induced suppressors also suppressed debcl-induced apoptosis.
('Four of Bax modifiers', 'had', 'no effect')
('Four of Bax modifiers', 'led to', 'phenotypes of penetrance')
('two', 'led to', 'phenotypes of penetrance')

Given that this gene is involved in the mitochondrial metabolism, and that numerous Bcl-2 family members act at the mitochondrial level, Gpo-1 seemed of high interest and we decided to focus on its study.
('family members', 'act at', 'level')
('gene', 'is involved in', 'metabolism')
('gene', 'act at', 'level')

To confirm our hypothesis, we tested whether RNAi against Gpo-1 or heterozygosity for a Gpo-1 hypomorph (Gpo-1291) or an amorph (Gpo-1n322) allele, could suppress Debcl overexpression-induced wing phenotype.
('RNAi', 'could suppress', 'Debcl wing phenotype')

Both RNAi and both Gpo-1 LOF heterozygous alleles suppressed debcl-induced phenotypes but the most complete and fully penetrant suppression was observed in flies heterozygous for the Gpo-1n322 mutation (Figure ).
('RNAi', 'suppressed', 'phenotypes')
('LOF alleles', 'suppressed', 'phenotypes')

Therefore, we decided to assess the apoptosis level in wing imaginal discs of flies heterozygous for Gpo-1n322.

The number of TUNEL positive cells in wing discs overexpressing debcl was dramatically reduced by Gpo-1n322 heterozygosity when compared to discs that are not mutated in Gpo-1 (Figure ), thus confirming that a reduction of Gpo-1 dosage suppresses debcl-induced apoptosis.
('reduction of dosage', 'suppresses', 'apoptosis')

Gpo-1 [EC 1.1.5.3], also known as glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, is encoded by a nuclear gene and located at the outer surface of the inner mitochondrial membrane.

It catalyzes the reaction:

sn-glycerol 3-phosphate + coenzyme Q10 -&gt; glycerone phosphate + reduced coenzyme Q10

Along with the cytosolic NAD-linked glycerol phosphate dehydrogenase (GPDH), Gpo-1 forms the glycerol phosphate shuttle that catalyzes the interconversion of glycerol phosphate and dihydroxyacetone phosphate to oxidize cytosolic NADH by transferring reducing equivalents from the cytosol to mitochondria.

Cytosolic GPDH has been shown to protect mammalian CHO cells against ROS-induced apoptosis [].
('GPDH', 'has been shown to protect', 'CHO cells')

On the opposite, mitochondrial Gpo-1 has been involved in superoxide production in various species (review: []) including Drosophila [], which is in agreement with a protective role of a dosage reduction of this gene.

Furthermore, we have observed that debcl overexpression can induce ROS accumulation thanks to a mitochondrial superoxyde indicator, i.e. MitoSOX.
('debcl overexpression', 'can induce', 'accumulation thanks to superoxyde indicator')

Indeed, debcl overexpression increases the proportion of MitoSOX positive cells in the wing imaginal discs compared to the ptc-gal4/+ control (Figure ).
('debcl overexpression', 'increases', 'proportion of MitoSOX cells')

Thus, we decided to test whether heterozygosity for the Gpo-1 null mutant could decrease ROS levels produced by debcl overexpression.
('heterozygosity for mutant', 'could decrease', 'ROS levels produced by debcl overexpression')

A significant decrease of MitoSOX positive cells was observed when debcl was overexpressed in a Gpo1n322 heterozygous background when compared to Gpo-1+/+ background (Figure ).
('debcl', 'was overexpressed in', 'Gpo1n322 background')

This result indicates that Gpo-1 participates in debcl-induced apoptosis by increasing ROS production.

DISCUSSION

This screen provides us with 17 suppressors of phenotypes induced by the expression of bax under control of the wing specific vg-GAL4 driver (lethality and wing notches).
('screen', 'provides', 'us')

The possibility that these suppressors affect GAL4 synthesis or that the selected insertions titrate the GAL4 transcription factor is unlikely, since our number of suppressors is limited (1.6% of the collection).
('suppressors', 'affect', 'GAL4 synthesis')
('suppressors', 'titrate', 'GAL4 transcription factor')
('insertions', 'titrate', 'GAL4 transcription factor')

Moreover, we isolated UYi insertions, which were not identified in other screens performed using the same collection and the UAS/Gal4 system [, ].

Finally, we have recently reported the specificity of one of the suppressors, UY3010, which corresponds to a gain-of-function of the Ubiquitin activating enzyme-encoding gene Uba1.

Indeed, Uba1 overexpression allows the degradation of Bax and Debcl, thanks to the activation of the ubiquitin/proteasome pathway [].
('Uba1 overexpression', 'allows', 'degradation of Bax')

We also showed in this study that Debcl is targeted to the proteasome by the E3 ubiquitin ligase Slimb, the β-TrCP homologue [].
('Debcl', 'is targeted to', 'that proteasome')

We found that 9 of the bax-modifiers also behaved as suppressors of debcl-induced wing phenotype while 4 showed no significant effect on this phenotype.

Three hypotheses could explain this discrepancy.
('hypotheses', 'could explain', 'discrepancy')

One possibility is that these bax modifiers are context artifacts and do not represent bona fide Bax interactors.
('bax modifiers', 'are', 'context artifacts')
('bax modifiers', 'do not represent', 'bona fide Bax interactors')

The second possible explanation involves the difference in the driver used in each assay (vg-GAL versus ptc-GAL).
('explanation', 'involves', 'difference in driver used in assay')

Indeed, UY3010 did not significantly suppress debcl-induced apoptosis while another Uba1 overexpression mutant (Uba1EP2375) did [].

Third, although Bax and Debcl, share similarities in their mode of action and regulation, some signaling pathways could be specific of bax-induced apoptosis.
('Bax', 'could be specific of', 'apoptosis')
('Debcl', 'could be specific of', 'apoptosis')
('share similarities in mode of action', 'could be specific of', 'apoptosis')
('signaling pathways', 'could be specific of', 'apoptosis')

Indeed, a LOF of brat mitigates neither debcl- (this paper) nor hid- or Sca3-induced cell death [].
('LOF of brat', 'mitigates', 'cell death')

The brat gene belongs to a group of suppressors, which is implicated in cell growth, proliferation or death.
('brat gene', 'belongs to', 'group of suppressors')

Mutations in this type of genes could compensate cell loss due to ectopic apoptosis induction.
('Mutations in type of genes', 'could compensate', 'cell loss')

Results observed for this group of modifiers can generally be easily interpreted with the literature data.
('Results observed for group of modifiers', 'can be interpreted with', 'literature data')

UY1131 corresponds to an insertion in the brat (for brain tumor) gene that could allow the expression of a truncated form of the protein.

To check whether this insertion leads to a LOF or a GOF of brat, we tested the effect of the characterized LOF allele bratk0602 on bax-induced phenotypes.
('insertion', 'leads to', 'LOF')

This mutation strongly suppressed (α=7.3×10−7) the wing phenotype showing that UY1131 is a LOF of brat (data not shown).

Brat belongs to the NHL family of proteins, represses translation of specific mRNAs 38] and is a negative regulator of cell growth [-].
('Brat', 'belongs to', 'NHL family of proteins')
('Brat', 'is', 'regulator of cell growth')

The suppression of bax-induced phenotypes by a LOF of brat could suggest that this gene also regulates cell death, which seems unlikely according to its inability to suppress other cell death pathways [].
('gene', 'regulates', 'cell death')

Alternatively brat could regulate somehow compensatory proliferation in this system.
('brat', 'could regulate', 'proliferation')

Some candidate suppressors encode proteins involved in secretion or components of the extra-cellular matrix.
('candidate suppressors', 'encode', 'proteins involved in secretion')

The effect of these genes could rely on cell signaling.
('effect of genes', 'could rely on', 'cell signaling')

Change in levels of secreted proteins could modify cell-extracellular matrix interactions and thus affect viability via processes similar to anoikis.
('Change in levels of proteins', 'could modify', 'matrix interactions')
('Change in levels of proteins', 'affect', 'viability')

Several suppressors are implicated in pathfinding (comm, comm3, hat, scratch and lola).
('suppressors', 'are implicated in', 'pathfinding')

Two hypotheses can be formulated.

Either neurons are of particular importance in bax-induced phenotypes or a more general role of these proteins in signaling is responsible for these suppressions.
('neurons', 'are of', 'importance')
('are of importance', 'is responsible for', 'suppressions')

If the neuronal death could explain the decreased survival of bax expressing flies, it could hardly explain the wing phenotypes.
('death', 'could explain', 'survival of bax expressing flies')

Therefore, these suppressor genes may have a more general role in signaling and in particular in cell death regulation.
('suppressor genes', 'may have', 'role in signaling')

For example, UY2669 corresponds to a GOF mutant of scratch (scrt).

This gene is a Drosophila homologue of C. elegans ces-1, which encodes a snail family zinc finger protein involved in controlling programmed death of specific neurons [].
('gene', 'is', 'Drosophila homologue of C. elegans')

Interestingly, a mammalian homologue of scratch, named Slug, is involved in a survival pathway that protects hematopoietic progenitors from apoptosis after DNA damage [].
('homologue of scratch named', 'is involved in', 'survival pathway')

Slug also antagonizes p53-mediated apoptosis by repressing the bcl-2-family pro-apoptotic gene puma [].
('Slug', 'antagonizes', 'apoptosis')

More recently, a regulatory loop linking p53/Puma with Scratch has been described in the vertebrate nervous system, not only controlling cell death in response to damage but also during normal embryonic development [].
('loop linking p53/Puma', 'has been described in', 'vertebrate system')

Another possibility is that these modifiers could affect some extracellular survival and/or death factors.
('modifiers', 'could affect', 'survival')

For example, sugarless, which was found twice in the screen, has been shown to interact with several survival pathways such as Wingless, EGF and FGF pathways that can play a role in defining shape and size of tissues and organs.

This result can be paralleled with the suppressive effect of mutations in hephaestus and lola, both of which interact with the Notch/Delta signaling.
('result', 'can be paralleled with', 'effect of mutations')

Notably, lola, a gene encoding a Polycomb group epigenetic silencer, has been shown to be required for programmed cell death in the Drosophila ovary [].
('lola', 'has been shown to be required for', 'cell death in Drosophila ovary')

Lola has also been identified for its role in normal phagocytosis of bacteria in Drosophila S2 cells and as a component of the Drosophila Imd pathway that is key to immunity [].
('Lola', 'has been identified for', 'role in phagocytosis of bacteria')

In contrast, Lola is required for axon growth and guidance in the Drosophila embryo [].
('Lola', 'is required for', 'axon growth')

This indicates that lola could play a role in cell adhesion and motility.
('lola', 'could play', 'role')

Accordingly, when coupled with overexpression of Delta, misregulation of pipsqueak and lola induces the formation of metastatic tumors associated with a downregulation of the Rbf (Retinoblastoma-family) gene [].

Other identified genes are involved in carbohydrate metabolism (Gpo-1 and CG8036 described as a transketolase).
('genes', 'are involved in', 'carbohydrate metabolism')

This result is in agreement with the evidence that Bcl-2 family proteins, in addition to their well characterized function in cell death, also play roles in metabolic processes in particular at the level of energetic metabolism (reviewed in []).
('result', 'is in', 'agreement with evidence')
('family proteins', 'play', 'roles')

In particular, Bcl-2 regulates mitochondrial respiration and the level of different ROS through a control of cytochrome c oxidase activity [].

Study of heterologous bax expression in yeast has provided clues on Bax function in relation to ROS (reviewed in [, ]) and yeast LOF mutants of genes involved in oxidative phosphorylation show increased sensitivity to Bax cytotoxicity [].
('Study of bax expression in yeast', 'has provided', 'clues on Bax function')

In agreement, Bcl-xL complements Saccharomyces cerevisiae genes that facilitate the switch from glycolytic to oxidative metabolism [].

Furthermore, both the anti-apoptotic effect of LOF mutations in Gpo-1 and the GOF in transketolase genes can be related to a protective effect against oxidative stress.
('effect of LOF mutations', 'can be related to', 'effect against stress')

This result suggests that the cell death process induced by Bax involves, at least in part, the modulation of different ROS levels.
('cell death process induced by Bax', 'involves', 'modulation of ROS levels')

Indeed, we report here that the suppressor effect of a null allele of Gpo-1 is associated with a decreased ability of Debcl to induce ROS production.
('suppressor effect of allele', 'is associated with', 'ability of Debcl to induce ROS production')

This result is in agreement with the observation that 70% of the total cellular H2O2 production was estimated to stem from Gpo-1 in isolated Drosophila mitochondria [].
('result', 'is in', 'agreement with observation')

This enzyme has also been implicated in ROS production in mammalian brown adipose tissue mitochondria when glycerol-3-phosphate was used as the respiratory substrate [] and, more recently, in prostate cancer cells [].
('enzyme', 'has been implicated in', 'ROS production in adipose tissue mitochondria')

In this latter case, ROS production seems to be beneficial to cancer cells, whereas we show here that it favors cell death in Drosophila wing disc cells.
('ROS production', 'seems to beneficial to', 'cancer cells')

This apparent contradiction could be related to the abnormal ROS production occurring during the oncogenic transformation and the shift to a glycolytic metabolism.
('contradiction', 'could be related to', 'ROS production occurring during transformation')

In conclusion, this study shows that Gpo-1 contributes to debcl-induced apoptosis by increasing reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and provides a substantial resource that will aid our efforts to understand the regulation of pro-apoptotic members of the Bcl-2 family proteins.

Screen for suppressors of lethality

UYi lines including a P-element insertion on the X, second or third chromosome were tested.

Concerning the screening of UYi lines carrying a P-element on the second chromosome, the survival rate in the progeny was evaluated as follows.

Each cross was performed with 7 virgin females and 3 males.
('cross', 'was performed with', 'females')

[vg&gt;bax/CyOGFP] virgin female flies were mated to [UYi/UYi] males when homozygous males were viable or, alternatively, to heterozygous [UYi/CyO] males.
('flies', 'were mated to', 'males')

In the first case, the survival rate corresponds to ([vg&gt;bax/UYi] / [UYi/CyOGFP]) while in the case of heterozygous mutant strains it corresponds to (([vg&gt;bax/CyO] + [vg&gt;bax/UYi]) / [UYi/CyOGFP]).
('survival rate', 'corresponds to', 'bax/UYi')

For UYi lines carrying the P-element on the third chromosome, virgin female flies [vg&gt;bax/CyOGFP ; +/+] were mated to viable [+/+ ; UYi/UYi] males or, alternatively, to [+/+ ; UYi/TM3] males.
('flies', 'were mated to', 'viable')

In the first case, the survival ratio corresponds to ([vg&gt;bax/+ ; UYi/+] / [CyOGFP/+ ; UYi/+]), while in the second case it was (([vg&gt;bax/+ ; UYi /+] + [vg&gt;bax/+ ; TM3/+]) / ([CyOGFP/+ ; UYi /+] + [CyOGFP/+ ; TM3/+])).

UYi lines located on the X chromosome were screened by crossing virgin [UYi/UYi ; +/+] or [UYi/FM0 ; +/+] female flies with [+/Y ; vg&gt;bax/CyOGFP] males.
('UYi lines located on X chromosome', 'were screened by', 'crossing UYi/UYi')

If the mutant line was homozygous, the survival ratio was (([UYi/+ ; vg&gt;bax/+]) / [UYi/+ ; CyOGFP/+]).
('survival ratio', 'was', 'UYi')

If the mutant line was balanced with FM0, the ratio was (([UYi/+ ; vg&gt;bax/+] + [FM0 /+ ; vg&gt;bax/+]) / ([UYi/+ ; CyOGFP/+] + [FM0/+ ; CyOGFP/+]).
('ratio', 'was', 'UYi')
('line', 'was balanced with', 'FM0')

For UYi insertions located on autosomes, only crosses giving rise to a progeny of at least 25 individuals including at least two [vg&gt;bax/UYi] were taken into account.
('crosses', 'were taken into', 'account')

For mutations of the X chromosome, only crosses giving rise to at least 25 individuals including at least 20 [UYi/+ ; CyOGFP /+] flies were taken into account.
('crosses', 'were taken into', 'account')

To study phenotypes and survival, crosses were performed at 18°C and after five days they were either kept at 18°C or switched to 25°C.
('crosses', 'were performed at', 'C')

UYi mutations were considered as suppressors of lethality if the survival rate was higher than the observed average survival rate plus one standard deviation, either at 18°C or 25°C..
('survival rate', 'was higher than', 'survival rate')
('UYi mutations', 'were considered as', 'suppressors of lethality')

The average survival rate and standard deviation were independently determined for each of the three chromosomes bearing the UYi transgene to take into account the genetic background impact.
('survival rate', 'were determined for', 'each of chromosomes bearing UYi transgene')
('deviation', 'were determined for', 'each of chromosomes bearing UYi transgene')

Classification of the wing phenotypes and the Wilcoxon test

All the lineages were analyzed in parallel with a control progeny and by a blind observer.
('lineages', 'were analyzed in', 'parallel with control progeny')

Flies were classified according to their wing phenotype (strong, intermediate or weak) as previously described [].
('Flies', 'were classified according', 'to')

For flies showing two different wing phenotypes, the strongest phenotype of both wings was used for classification.

In our screen, we have analyzed the distribution of graded phenotypes based on their expressivity.

The Wilcoxon test was used to compare the distributions of the phenotypes between two lineages A and B [].
('Wilcoxon test', 'was used to compare', 'distributions of phenotypes')

The sign of the WsA-B value determines whether the distribution A is stronger than B (Ws&lt;0) or whether the distribution B is stronger than A (Ws&gt;0).
('distribution A', 'is stronger than', 'B')
('distribution A', 'is stronger than', 'A')
('distribution B', 'is stronger than', 'A')

We considered the difference between A and B significant when αA-B&lt;10−3.

Molecular characterization of UYi lines

To characterize the genes identified by screening for bax-induced phenotype modifiers, the DNA flanking the P[Mae-UAS.6.11] element was isolated by inverse polymerase chain reaction (PCR), essentially according to the Berkeley Drosophila Genome Project (BDGP) protocol (http://www.fruitfly.org/about/methods/inverse.pcr.html) and sequenced.
('DNA flanking', 'was isolated by', 'polymerase chain reaction')

The following primers were used in this study:

5′-GGTAAGCTTCGGCTATCGAC-3′,

5′-GCTTTCGCTTAGCGACGTGT-3′,

5′-ACACAACCTTTCCTCTCAACAA-3′,

5′-GAATTGAATTGTCGCTCCGT-3′,

5′-ATTGATTCACTTTAACTTGCAC-3′.

Sequencing was performed by Genecust (Genopole, Evry, France).
('Sequencing', 'was performed by', 'Genecust')

Sequences were submitted to BLAST search in the BDGP database to identify nearby genes.
('Sequences', 'were submitted to', 'BLAST search in BDGP database')

Quantification of ptc-Gal4&gt;(UAS-debcl)2-induced phenotype in the wing

To test the implication of Gpo-1 in debcl-induced apoptosis, the severity of the wing tissue loss induced by UAS-debcl overexpression led by ptc-Gal4 driver was measured in different genetic backgrounds.
('severity of wing tissue loss induced by overexpression led by driver', 'was measured in', 'backgrounds')

We first verified that the Gpo1n322 LOF mutation did not induce any wing phenotype by itself.
('Gpo1n322 LOF mutation', 'did not induce', 'wing phenotype')

Then, ptc&gt;debcl2, females were crossed with wild-type males or males bearing a LOF mutation for Gpo-1.
('females', 'were crossed with', 'males')

For each progeny, the distance between veins L3 and L4 was measured perpendicularly to the sixth sensilla of the dorsal row of the anterior wing margin and plotted against the distance between the extremity of veins 4 and 5.
('distance between veins L3', 'plotted against', 'distance between extremity of veins')

Student's t-tests were then performed.

TUNEL staining

As previously described [, ], third instar larvae were dissected in PBS pH 7.6, fixed in PBS/formaldehyde 3.7%, washed three times for 10min in PBT (1X PBS, 0.5% Triton).
('instar larvae', 'were dissected in', 'PBS pH')

Discs were then dissected and TUNEL staining was performed according to manufacturer's instructions (ApopTag Red in situ apoptosis detection kit, Millipore, Temecula, CA, USA).

Discs were mounted in CitifluorTM (Biovalley, Marne-La-Vallée, France) and observed with a Leica SPE upright confocal microscope (Leica, Wetzlar, Germany).
('Discs', 'were mounted in', 'CitifluorTM')
('Discs', 'observed with', 'Leica SPE microscope')

White patches in the ptc expression domain were counted for at least 30 wing imaginal discs per genotype.
('White patches in ptc expression domain', 'were counted for', 'wing discs per genotype')

Student's t-tests were then performed.

Mitochondrial superoxide measurement

MitoSOX (Molecular Probes, Thermo Fisher Scientific) was used to measure the mitochondrial production of superoxide as described in [].
('MitoSOX', 'was used to measure', 'production of superoxide')

Briefly, twenty wing imaginal discs were dissected in Schneider's Drosophila medium (Fisher Bioblock scientific, Illkirch Graffenstaden, France), then cells were trypsinized.
('wing discs', 'were dissected in', 'Drosophila medium')

5 μM MitoSOX were added to the cells placed at 37°C.
('mM MitoSOX', 'were added to', 'cells placed at C.')

Red fluorescence was then measured by flow cytometry in 2000 events per experimental condition.
('Red fluorescence', 'was measured by', 'flow cytometry')

Flow cytometric measurement was performed using a BD LSRFortessa (Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, USA).
('Flow measurement', 'was performed using', 'BD LSRFortessa')

Fluorescence was induced by the Yellow-Green Laser (561 nm).
('Fluorescence', 'was induced by', 'Laser')

Red fluorescence was collected with a PE detector (emission: 578 nm).
('Red fluorescence', 'was collected with', 'PE detector')
