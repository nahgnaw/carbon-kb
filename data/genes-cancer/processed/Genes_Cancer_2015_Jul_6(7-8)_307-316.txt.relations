We also showed that RBEL1A directly interacted with p53 and such interactions occurred at the oligomeric domain of p53.

However, the effect of such interactions on p53 oligomerization and function remained to be investigated.

Here, we report that the interaction of RBEL1A and p53 suppressed p53 oligomer formation in unstressed cells and in cells exposed to DNA damage.
('interaction of RBEL1A', 'suppressed', 'p53 oligomer formation in cells')

Furthermore, purified RBEL1A blocked the oligomerization of recombinant p53 corresponding to residues 315-360 in vitro.

RBEL1A also significantly reduced the oligomerization of the exogenously expressed C-terminal region (residues 301-393) of p53 in cells.

Overexpression of RBEL1A (as seen in human tumors), also suppressed oligomerization by endogenous p53.
('Overexpression of RBEL1A', 'suppressed', 'oligomerization')

Our results also showed that GTPase domain of RBEL1A at residues 1-235 was sufficient to block p53 oligomerization.
('GTPase domain of RBEL1A', 'was sufficient to block', 'p53 oligomerization')

Furthermore, silencing of endogenous RBEL1A significantly enhanced the formation of p53 oligomeric complex following ultraviolet radiation-mediated DNA damage and RBEL1A knockdown also enhanced expression of p53 target genes.

INTRODUCTION

The p53 tumor suppressor is activated in response to various stresses induced by physical and chemical mutagens, and thereby safeguards genome integrity by preventing the acquisition of genomic alterations.
('p53 tumor suppressor', 'is activated in', 'response to stresses induced by mutagens')

p53 predominantly functions as a transcription factor and to date, more than 60 p53 target genes have been identified that are implicated in regulation of (i) cell cycle arrest, (ii) DNA repair, iii) apoptosis/senescence [1, 2].

Clearly, p53 is an important molecule and its inactivation is believed to be a critical step in tumorigenesis.
('molecule', 'is believed to step in', 'tumorigenesis')
('inactivation', 'is believed to step in', 'tumorigenesis')

In unstressed cells, p53 exists as monomers that are constitutively ubiquitinated by various E3 ligases, such as MDM2, and rapidly degraded [3-5].

In response to cellular stresses including DNA damage, the p53 stability is enhanced as the p53 monomers oligomerize to form dimers, and subsequently two dimers oligomerize to form tetramers.
('p53 monomers', 'oligomerize to form', 'dimers')
('dimers', 'oligomerize to form', 'tetramers')
('p53 stability', 'oligomerize to form', 'tetramers')

It has recently been reported that in unstressed cells, p53 appears to exist in a mixture of various oligomeric states but following DNA damage, it rapidly assumes a tetrameric conformation [6].

The structure of the tetramerization domain (TD) of p53 has been resolved by different groups using X-ray crystallography [7-8] and NMR [9].
('structure of tetramerization domain', 'has been resolved by', 'groups')

The p53 TD is a hairpin-like structure, consisting of a β-strand (amino acid residues 326-333), an α-helix (amino acid residues 335-356) and a glycine (amino acid residue 334) located at the tip of the hairpin [7].
('p53 TD', 'is', 'structure consisting')

The computational models suggest that the β-strand from each TD forms an anti-parallel dimer and the α-helices from each dimer oligomerize to form a p53 tetramer giving rise to a tetrameric-helical bundle [10].

It is thought that a p53 tetramer is formed by dimerization of two dimers and this step is crucial for p53 activation as well as DNA-binding to initiate transactivation of target genes [10].
('step', 'is crucial for', 'p53 activation')
('p53 tetramer', 'is formed by', 'dimerization of dimers')
('p53 tetramer', 'is crucial for', 'p53 activation')

It has also been shown that although p53 dimers are capable of binding to DNA, formation of tetramers can enhance p53 DNA binding affinity by more than 50 folds [11].
('p53 dimers', 'are capable of', 'binding to DNA')
('formation of tetramers', 'can enhance', 'p53 DNA binding affinity')

The p53 tetramer is believed to behave as a pair of DNA clamps that, with concurrent interactions of both dimers, allows dramatic stabilization of p53-DNA binding [11].

Thus, p53 tetramerization is essential to its function as a transcription factor.
('p53 tetramerization', 'is essential to', 'function')

Given the importance of tetramerization, it is not surprising that some cancer cells have acquired various strategies to escape from p53-mediated cellular control by inhibiting p53 tetramerization.
('cancer cells', 'have acquired to escape', 'strategies')

In this context, a number of proteins have been documented inhibiting p53 oligomerization.
('number of proteins', 'have been documented inhibiting', 'p53 oligomerization')

For example, it has been demonstrated that S100B protein specifically interacts with the TD of p53 monomers but rarely with the p53 tetramers, thus, shifting the equilibrium in favor of monomeric conformation with an inhibitory effect on p53 transactivation function [12-13].
('S100B protein', 'interacts with', 'TD of p53 monomers')

It has also been shown that Apoptosis Repressor with Caspase recruitment domain (ARC) protein also interacts with p53 and interferes with p53 tetramerization [14].
('Apoptosis Repressor with domain protein', 'interacts with', 'p53')
('Apoptosis Repressor with domain protein', 'interferes with', 'p53 tetramerization')

These studies demonstrate that inhibition of p53 oligomerization is one of the important mechanisms in negative regulation of p53's function.

We have previously identified a novel Ras-superfamily protein, namely RBEL1A [15-16].

In our previous studies, RBEL1A has been shown to be overexpressed in multiple human malignancies, including breast and colon tumors [15].

RBEL1A is a glycosylated protein that harbors a Ras/Rab-like GTPase domain at its N-terminus [15].

Furthermore, depletion of RBEL1A causes severe growth suppression in cancer cells [16].
('depletion of RBEL1A', 'causes', 'growth suppression in cancer cells')

Our subsequent studies have further demonstrated that RBEL1A facilitates MDM2-mediated p53 protein ubiquitination and degradation [17].

Depletion of RBEL1A prolongs p53 half-life associated with increased p53 levels; whereas overexpression of RBEL1A reduces p53 levels under unstressed and genotoxic stressed conditions [17].
('overexpression of RBEL1A', 'reduces', 'p53 levels')

Our previous studies also have indicated that RBEL1A interacts with oligomeric domain of p53 [17], and thus raises the possibility that such interactions may interfere with the formation of p53 tetramers.
('interactions', 'may interfere with', 'formation of p53 tetramers')

In this study, we sought to examine whether RBEL1A-p53 interactions interfere with p53 tetramerization and transactivation.
('interactions', 'interfere with', 'p53 tetramerization')

Our current results indicate that RBEL1A blocks p53 oligomerization in vitro and inside the cells.

Our results further indicate that RBEL1A GTPase domain (at residues 1-235) alone is sufficient to block p53 oligomerization.
('RBEL1A GTPase domain', 'is sufficient to block', 'p53 oligomerization')

Depletion of RBEL1A in cells also enhanced the formation of p53 oligomeric complex in response to UV-mediated DNA damage.
('Depletion of RBEL1A', 'enhanced', 'formation of p53 complex')

Collectively, our results demonstrate that, in addition to its function in enhancing MDM2-mediated p53 ubiquitination, RBEL1A negatively regulates p53 function by blocking p53 oligomerization.

RESULTS

RBEL1A blocks p53 oligomerization

In our previous study, we have demonstrated that RBEL1A interacts with p53; the endogenous p53 and RBEL1A associate with each other in cells and the purified recombinant p53 and RBEL1A proteins form complex in vitro [17].

Furthermore, RBEL1A interacts with p53 at the C-terminal region of p53 [17], which is critical for p53 oligomerization [7].

For the current studies, we tried to examine whether RBEL1A could interfere with p53 oligomerization and function via its association with p53's C-terminus.

To that end, we first generated two different vectors each expressing the C-terminus of p53 corresponding to residues 301-393, one of which was tagged with the His-tag (His-tag p53−301-393) and the other fused with the Myc-tag (Myc-tag p53-301-393).

Several studies have shown that p53 tetramerization domain alone can spontaneously form tetramers [7, 28].
('p53 tetramerization domain', 'can form', 'tetramers')

Thus, we first sought to determine whether RBEL1A interferes with the interactions among the C-termini of p53 i.e. His-tagged and Myc-tagged p53-301-393.

As shown in Figure 1A, the His-tagged p53-301-393 was capable of pulling down the Myc-tagged p53-301-393 (Figure 1A, lane 1 upper panel), indicating that the C-terminal region of p53 fused with different tags does indeed exhibit interactions.

Figure 1A also shows that, in the presence of RBEL1A, the interaction between the His- and Myc-tagged p53-301-393 was significantly reduced (lane 2, upper panel).

These results suggest that RBEL1A disrupts the interactions among the C-terminal monomers of p53.

Figure 1 RBEL1A interacts with p53 and blocks p53 (C-terminus) monomer interaction

(A) RBEL1A inhibits p53 (301-393) monomer interaction in cells.

HEK293T cells were co-transfected with vectors carrying His-tagged p53 (301-393) and Myc-tagged p53 (301-393) together with HA-tagged RBEL1A expression vector or HA-tag empty vector.

Twenty four hours after transfection, cells were lysed and His-tag protein pull-down assays were performed as described in Materials and Methods.

The precipitants were analyzed by Western blotting using anti-myc tag antibodies to determine the interaction between His-tagged and Myc-tagged p53 (upper panel) in the absence (lane 1) or presence (lane 2) of RBEL1A.

(B) RBEL1A prevents recombinant p53 (315-360) oligomerization in vitro.

In vitro p53 oligomerization assays were performed as described in Materials and Methods using the purified recombinant p53 (315-360) incubated either with recombinant RBEL1A or BSA prior to crosslink by glutaraldehyde (GA).

RBEL1A (1) and RBEL1A (2) were different purifications of RBEL1A protein.

RBEL1A protein in purification (1) has larger molecular mass (glycosylated) whereas purification (2) contains RBEL1A with smaller molecular mass (unglycosylated or less glycosylated).
('RBEL1A protein in purification', 'has', 'mass')
('purification', 'contains', 'RBEL1A with mass')

The reaction mixtures were separated by SDS-PAGE and the p53 oligomers (as indicated by arrows) were visualized by western blotting using anti-p53 antibody.
('separated', 'were visualized by', 'western blotting')

To further investigate the negative effect of RBEL1A on p53 oligomerization, we performed in vitro interaction assays using the purified recombinant proteins corresponding to the (i) C-terminal variant of p53 containing residues 315-360 (p53-Oligo-D) [18] and (ii) purified full-length RBEL1A.

The purified p53-Oligo-D was incubated with the recombinant RBEL1A protein (at 1:1 or 1:2 molar ratios) prior to treatment with chemical cross-linker glutaraldehyde (GA).

GA has been used in several previous studies of p53 oligomerization [19, 29].
('GA', 'has been used in', 'studies of p53 oligomerization')

As a negative control, the bovine serum albumin (BSA) was also used instead of the purified RBEL1A.

The reaction products were then analyzed by anti-p53 immunoblotting to observe the oligomerization of p53.
('reaction products', 'were analyzed by', 'immunoblotting')

As shown in Figure 1B, the p53-Oligo-D existed as monomers in the absence of GA (lane 1) but formed typical oligomers corresponding to dimers, trimers and tetramers in the presence of GA (lane 2).

However, pre-incubation of p53-Oligo-D fragments with purified RBEL1A (1:1 ratio) but not with BSA (1:1 ratio) clearly inhibited oligomerization by p53-Oligo-D (Figure 1C, compared lane 3 with lanes 4 and 5).

Furthermore, increasing the amount of RBEL1A to p53 at 2:1 molar ratio of did not further enhance the effect of RBEL1A on p53-Oligo-D oligomerization (lanes 7 &amp; 8) indicating that RBEL1A:p53 at 1:1 ratio was sufficient to inhibit p53 oligomerization.

Next, we investigated the effect of RBEL1A on p53 oligomerization inside the cells and for that purpose, HEK293T cells were transiently transfected with Myc-tagged C-terminus-p53 (p53-301-393) expression construct along with increasing amounts of RBEL1A expression vector or control empty vector.
('HEK293T cells', 'were transfected with', 'expression construct')

As shown in Figure 2A, increasing amounts of RBEL1A vector, but not that of the control vector, led to a gradual decrease in the levels of p53 dimers and tetramers (compared with lanes 4-6 with lanes 1-3).
('amounts of RBEL1A vector', 'led to', 'decrease in levels of p53 dimers')

We next determined whether RBEL1A affects oligomerization of endogenous p53 inside the cells.

In order to observe the effect of RBEL1A on p53 oligomerization, cells were introduced with increasing amounts of RBEL1A expression vector or control empty vector and then were treated with proteasome inhibitor MG132 to prevent RBEL1A-triggered p53 degradation [17].
('cells', 'were introduced with', 'amounts of RBEL1A expression vector')
('cells', 'were treated with', 'proteasome inhibitor MG132')

As shown in the Figure 2B, increasing amount of RBEL1A also led to a gradual decrease in the levels of endogenous p53 dimmers and tetramers.
('amount of RBEL1A', 'led to', 'decrease in levels of p53 dimmers')

Thus, our results involving in vitro as well as in-cell (intracellular) assays indicate that RBEL1A interferes with p53 oligomerization and that it does so via its direct interactions with the p53 oligomerization domain.

Glutaraldehyde (GA, 0.005%) was used to crosslink the cell lysates and incubated for 10 minutes prior to adding the protein loading buffer (with 5% of 2-mercaptoethanol, no boiling) to stop crosslink reaction.

RBEL1A GTPase domain (residues 1-235) alone is sufficient to block p53 to form oligomers
('RBEL1A GTPase domain', 'is sufficient to block', 'p53')

Next, we sought to determine the minimal region of RBEL1A that was required to inhibit p53 oligomerization.

We have previously demonstrated that RBEL1A interacts with p53 via its N-terminal GTPase domain (residues 1-235) that shares high degree of homology with other RAS superfamily GTPAses [17] and results in Figure 3A reconfirm this finding.

In light of these results, we sought to determine whether the N-terminal region of RBEL1A (GTPase domain) is sufficient to interfere with p53 oligomer formation.
('region of RBEL1A', 'is sufficient to interfere with', 'p53 oligomer formation')

In HEK293T cells, we introduced the HA-only or HA-RBEL1A (residues 1-235) expression constructs and western blotting was performed to examine the p53 oligomer formation in the presence or absence of exogenous RBEL1A.

Figure 3B shows that increased amounts of HA-tagged RBEL1A, but not the HA-tag-only, led to a gradual decrease in the levels of p53 dimers and tetramers.
('amounts of RBEL1A', 'led to', 'decrease in levels of p53 dimers')

Thus, these results demonstrate that the GTPase domain (a.a.
('results', 'demonstrate that', 'GTPase domain')

1-235) of RBEL1A alone is sufficient to inhibit oligomerization of p53.

We also investigated the impact of RBEL1A knockdown (KD) on p53 oligomerization and transactivation of its target genes.

MCF7 human breast cancer cells that harbor wild-type p53 were used in which RBEL1A was knocked down via shRNA approach.

The cells harboring RBEL1A shRNA or scramble shRNA were either not treated or exposed to UV irradiation (as described in Materials and Methods).
('cells harboring RBEL1A shRNA scramble shRNA', 'exposed to', 'UV irradiation')

For all cell lysates, glutaraldehyde (GA) was used to cross-link p53 proteins prior to the protein denaturation in the loading buffer and oligomer formation of p53 was subsequently determined by western blotting.
('used', 'was determined by', 'western blotting')

As shown in Figure 4A, under unstressed condition, the levels of p53 dimer, but not tetramer, were modestly higher in the cells harboring RBEL1A shRNA as compared with those containing the scramble shRNA (compare lane 6 to lane 3).
('levels of p53 dimer', 'were higher in', 'cells harboring RBEL1A shRNA')

Interestingly, after UV exposure, the levels of p53 dimer and tetramer in the RBEL1A shRNA expressing cells were significantly higher than those detected in the scramble shRNA carrying cells (compare with lane 12 to lane 9).
('levels of p53 dimer', 'were higher than', 'those detected in scramble shRNA carrying cells')

These results indicate that RBEL1A appears to block p53 oligomer formation, especially in cells exposed to DNA damage and silencing of RBEL1A favors p53 oligomer formation.

In parallel, we also noted that RBEL1A knockdown increased mRNA expression of p53 target genes including p21 and PUMA (Figure 4B).
('RBEL1A knockdown', 'increased', 'mRNA expression of p53 target genes including p21')

Taken together, these results indicate that RBEL1A negatively regulates p53 oligomerization and that is coupled with inhibition of p53 transcriptional activity.

DISCUSSION

Previous studies have shown that oligomerization is one of the crucial steps for p53 activation and important for its tumor suppressor function [20-21].

Under unstressed conditions, p53 is believed to predominantly exist as latent monomers, however, when cells encounter intracellular or extracellular stresses, the monomers rapidly oligomerize to form dimmers, and then tetramers.
('cells', 'encounter', 'stresses')
('monomers', 'oligomerize to form', 'dimmers')

Tetramerized p53 then binds to and transactivates promoters of various target genes that are linked to different functions such as cell cycle arrest, cell death, cellular senescence and DNA repair [2].

In light of the importance of p53 oligomerization, proteins that interfere with p53 oligomer formation are expected to profoundly affect p53 function.

Several proteins have been shown to interact with the tetramerization domain of p53 and affect p53 oligomerization.
('proteins', 'have been shown to interact with', 'tetramerization domain of p53')

For example, S100A and S100B, members of the S100 protein family, have been shown to interact with the tetramerization domain of p53, and such interaction leads to the blockade of p53 oligomerization [13-14, 22].
('interaction', 'leads to', 'blockade of p53 oligomerization')

The expression of S100A4 and S100B was found to be elevated in a number of human malignancies [23-24].
('expression of S100A4', 'was found to elevated in', 'number of malignancies')

Studies have also shown that Apoptosis Repressor with Caspase recruitment domain (ARC) protein also regulates p53 tetramerization by its direct binding with p53 tetramerization domain [14].
('Apoptosis Repressor with domain protein', 'regulates', 'p53 tetramerization')

Knockdown of ARC in breast cancer cells led to nuclear accumulation as well as increased tetramerization of p53 coupled with activation of p53 target genes [14].
('Knockdown of ARC', 'led to', 'accumulation')

Interestingly, elevated ARC expression was also noted in human cancer cells [25].
('ARC expression', 'was noted in', 'cancer cells')

Likewise, our results suggest that RBEL1A may function in a similar fashion to regulate p53 tetramerization.

Our previous studies demonstrated that RBEL1A interacts with p53 at p53's tetrameric domain [17] and our current studies show that the interactions between p53-RBEL1A inhibit p53 oligomerization (Figure 1-3).
('interactions', 'inhibit', 'p53 oligomerization')

Our results suggest that RBEL1A:p53 1:1 ratio is sufficient to prevent p53 to form oligomers (Figure 1C).
('results', 'suggest that', 'RBEL1A')
('p53 ratio', 'is sufficient to prevent', 'p53')

Importantly, our results also demonstrate that following DNA damage, depletion of RBEL1A led to increased p53 oligomerization (Figure 4A) and RBEL1A knockdown also increases p53 target gene expression (Figure 4B).
('depletion of RBEL1A', 'led to', 'p53 oligomerization')

In context to these findings, our previous studies have shown that RBEL1A is overexpressed in multiple human malignancies including breast cancer and colon cancer [15].

More recently a study by Li et al [30] have also shown that RBEL1A expression is significantly elevated in a large portion of primary breast cancers and high levels of RBEL1A expression correlates with poor survival in breast cancer patients [30].
('RBEL1A expression', 'is elevated in', 'portion of breast cancers')
('RBEL1A expression', 'correlates with', 'survival in breast cancer patients')
('levels of RBEL1A expression', 'correlates with', 'survival in breast cancer patients')

Based on our collective findings from current and previous studies, we propose a possible model via which RBEL1A negatively regulates p53.

As is shown in Fig. 5, in normal unstressed cells, p53 is expressed at very low levels and exists predominantly as monomers and dimers.

The expression levels of RBEL1A are also low in the normal cells (15, 30).
('expression levels of RBEL1A', 'are low in', 'cells')

In response to DNA damage, p53 is phosphorylated, stabilized and forms tetramers to transactivate p53 target genes that induce cell cycle arrest, DNA repair and apoptosis.

In cancer cells, RBEL1A expression levels are significantly elevated [15, 30].

Abundant RBEL1A are available for interacting with p53, preventing p53 dimer and tetramer formations and sequestering p53 in the monomeric state.

Such action of RBEL1A blocks the transactivational function of p53 in inducing cell cycle arrest and apoptosis following DNA damage which favors tumor formation.
('action of RBEL1A', 'blocks', 'function of p53')

Figure 5 Schematic illustration of the proposed model by which RBEL1A negatively regulates p53 and promotes tumor formation

In normal unstressed cells, p53 is expressed at low levels and exists predominantly as monomers and dimers.

RBEL1A expression level is also low in the normal cells (15).
('RBEL1A expression level', 'is low in', 'cells')

Following DNA damage, p53 is phosphorylated, stabilized and forms tetramers to transactivate its target genes that induce cell cycle arrest, DNA repair and apoptosis.

In cancer cells, RBEL1A is significantly overexpressed [15, 30].

RBEL1A directly interacts with p53 and prevents p53 to form dimers and tetramers.

Therefore, RBEL1A blocks the transactivational function of p53 in inducing cell cycle arrest and apoptosis following DNA damage which favors tumor formation.

Interestingly, our studies also demonstrate that RBEL1A GTPase domain alone (residues 1-235) is sufficient to interfere with p53 oligomer formation (Figure 3B).
('RBEL1A GTPase domain', 'is sufficient to interfere with', 'p53 oligomer formation')

These findings would suggest that the physical interaction between RBEL1A and p53, rather the GTP-binding potential or the GTPase activity of RBEL1A, appears to be critical for RBEL1A to obstruct p53 tetramer formation.
('interaction between RBEL1A', 'appears to critical for', 'RBEL1A to obstruct p53 tetramer formation')

Presumably, RBEL1A-p53 interaction prevents p53 monomers to form the oligomeric complex because the oligomeric region is engaged by RBEL1A.
('interaction', 'prevents to form', 'p53 monomers')
('region', 'is engaged by', 'RBEL1A')

Our previous studies had demonstrated that the GTP-binding defective mutants of RBEL1A were still capable of interacting with p53 [17].
('mutants of RBEL1A', 'were capable of', 'interacting with p53')

Based on these findings, it is possible that the GTP-binding activity of RBEL1A is not required for its interaction with p53.
('activity of RBEL1A', 'is not required for', 'interaction with p53')

Future studies are needed to further dissect the molecular details of RBEL1A-mediated regulation of p53 oligomerization.
('studies', 'are needed to dissect', 'details of regulation of p53 oligomerization')

Our current studies thus provide additional new information about the mechanism by which p53 function is regulated and also the molecular insights into the oncogenic role of RBEL1A in the context to human malignancy.

Immunoblotting and immunoprecipitation analyses

Immunoblotting and immunoprecipitation were performed as we have previously described (17, 26).

His-tag pull down assay

Myc-tagged and His-tagged p53 (residues 301-393) were co-transfected with pSRα-RBEL1A or HA-alone vectors in HEK293T cells.

Twenty-four hours later, cells were harvested, lysed and ~3 mg of total protein were then mixed with 60 μl of Ni-NTA His•Bind Resin and incubated and rocked at 4°C for 5 hours.

Protein-binding resins were washed extensively and eluted by loading buffer containing 5% β-mecaptoethanol.
('resins', 'eluted by', 'buffer containing')

Proteins from the elutes were separated by SDS-PAGE gel and western blots were performed using anti-Myc or anti-His antibodies.
('Proteins from elutes', 'were separated by', 'gel')

In vitro p53 oligomerization assay

Purified recombinant polypeptide, harboring the p53 tetramerization domain (TD) (residues 315-360) [18], was incubated with either the purified recombinant RBEL1A protein or bovine serum albumin for 1 hour at 4°C and then cross-linked with glutaraldehyde (GA) for 5 minutes at 4°C.
('polypeptide harboring p53 tetramerization domain', 'was incubated with', 'RBEL1A protein')

The mixture was resolved by SDS-PAGE gel and immunoblotting was performed using polyclonal anti-p53 antibody (FL-393, Santa Cruz).
