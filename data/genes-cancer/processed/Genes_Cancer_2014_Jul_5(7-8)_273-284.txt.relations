INTRODUCTION

Genetic rearrangements involving DNA sequences from different chromosomes or intrachromosomal regions have been extensively documented in various cancers, including prostate cancer (CaP) [].
('rearrangements involving DNA sequences from chromosomes', 'have been documented in', 'cancers')

It has been reported that male hormone dependent ETS-related transcription factors play causal roles in CaP, as a result of rearrangements.
('transcription factors', 'play', 'roles')

Hence, gene fusions involving the ETS family have potential value in cancer diagnosis, prognosis, and therapy [-].
('gene fusions involving ETS family', 'have', 'value in cancer diagnosis')

Of these, overexpression of the ETS-related gene (ERG) [, ], resulting from the fusion of ERG coding sequences to the androgen-responsive TMPRSS2 gene [], represents the most common subtype among ETS fusions, with a prevalence of approximately 50% in clinically localized prostate cancers [-, -].

In addition, studies evaluating the expression of ERG in epithelial cells of matched benign and malignant prostate cells from a large patient cohort indicate that CaP cells harboring TMPRSS2-ERG fusion show overexpression of ERG in 60-70% of patients [].
('studies evaluating expression of ERG', 'indicate that', 'CaP cells harboring fusion show overexpression of ERG')

This genomic rearrangement is now established as one of the most common mechanisms of oncogenic activation in CaP [-].
('rearrangement', 'is established as', 'one of mechanisms of activation in CaP')

ERG has also been originally implicated in Ewing's sarcoma and acute myeloid leukemia [-].
('ERG', 'has been implicated in', 'sarcoma')

The multi-exon structure of ERG is transcribed to nine different splice variants by a combination of alternative transcription initiation, mRNA splicing, and transcription termination [, , ].
('structure of ERG', 'is transcribed to', 'splice variants')

These variants can be divided into near full length (lacking 32 N-terminal amino acids) Type I ERG, containing the DNA-binding domain (DBD), with the embedded nuclear localization signal (NLS) and Type II ERG, a truncated form lacking DBD/NLS coding sequences [].
('variants', 'can be divided into', 'length')

The analysis of CaP associated fusion transcripts has revealed the presence of multiple splice variants, potentially exhibiting different biological activities and correlating with different tumor phenotypes [, , -].
('analysis of CaP fusion transcripts', 'has revealed', 'presence of splice variants')

Along these lines, our laboratory cloned and sequenced the relatively abundant full length TMPRSS2-ERG cDNAs from a pool of mRNAs from six TMPRSS2-ERG positive prostate tumors.
('laboratory', 'cloned', 'length cDNAs from pool of mRNAs')

In addition to the expected near full length fusion transcripts, we also identified mRNA splice variants of fusion transcripts lacking the C- terminus of ERG beyond exon 12 (Owczarek nomenclature), which was replaced by sequences resulting in the addition of 4 and 70 unique amino acids in TEPC1 and ERG8, respectively [, ].

The translated products of most of the various ERG transcripts have been shown to function as oncoproteins retaining the ETS domain with transforming activity [, , , ].
('products of most of ERG transcripts', 'have been shown to function as', 'oncoproteins retaining ETS domain')

In addition, ERG, similar to other members of the ETS family, has been described as a mediator of mitogenic signals, such as mitogen activator protein kinases [].
('ERG', 'has been described as', 'mediator of signals')

The relationship between the ERG transcripts and prognosis of CaP, however, is not clear.

Analyses have shown that a specific variant is associated with an aggressive form of disease [], while Hermans et al.
('variant', 'is associated with', 'form of disease')

[] showed a favorable prognosis of CaP with another variant.

This scenario highlights the need to evaluate the specific function of the different ERG-encoded proteins in the context of CaP.
('scenario', 'highlights', 'need to evaluate function of proteins')

This knowledge will further our understanding of ERG towards its clinical utility, including patient stratification, treatment monitoring, and therapeutic targeting of CaP.

In this regard, we hypothesized that the variants may function either additively, synergistically, or in a dominant negative fashion due to potential interactions, or competition, between the different splice forms.
('variants', 'may function', 'additively synergistically in')

Such an interaction may modify the physiological responses of ERG protein, which include transcriptional activation, cell growth, differentiation, and apoptosis.
('interaction', 'may modify', 'responses of ERG protein')

To address this, we utilized the two most abundant prototypic variants described in CaP tumors, designated TMPRSS2-ERG3 (Type I) and TMPRSS2-ERG8 (Type II), and assessed their effects alone and in combination, using in vitro cell culture models.

Our data show that TMPRSS2-ERG8 exhibited a dominant negative effect over TMPRSS-ERG3 mediated transcriptional regulation.

Furthermore, the demonstration of a physical interaction between the variants may provide the basis for the functional antagonism.
('demonstration of interaction between variants', 'may provide', 'basis for antagonism')

In addition, analysis of the ratio of Type I/Type II ERG in relation with the prevalent oncogene C-MYC may be of value as a biomarker in prostate cancer diagnosis and prognosis.
('analysis of ratio of Type I/Type ERG', 'may be of', 'value')

RESULTS

ERG encoded proteins localize to distinct regions within cells
('ERG', 'encoded', 'proteins')

For functional studies, TMPRSS2-ERG3 and TMPRSS2-ERG8 coding sequences were cloned into a pIRES-EGFP eukaryotic expression vector.
('coding sequences', 'were cloned into', 'expression vector')

A schematic representation of both constructs, in comparison to wild type ERG3 (wt-ERG3), is presented in Figure . In order to examine the subcellular localization of ERG proteins, TMPRSS2-ERG3 and TMPRSS2-ERG8 coding sequences were fused to GFP and RFP tags at the C-termini, respectively.
('representation of constructs', 'is presented in', 'Figure')

The expression of tagged proteins was verified in HEK293 cells by immunoblot analysis, using the CPDR ERG mouse monoclonal antibody, 9FY [, ].
('expression of proteins', 'was verified in', 'HEK293 cells')

Since 9FY recognizes an epitope present at the N-terminus, both TMPRSS2-ERG3 and TMPRSS2-ERG8 can be detected in the molecular weight range of 53 kDa and 38 kDa, respectively.

Alternatively, TMPRSS2-ERG3-GFP and TMPRSS2-ERG8-RFP revealed chimeric proteins in the range of 79 and 64 kDa, respectively (Figure ).

The subcellular localization of proteins was examined by microscopy, upon transfection of TMPRSS2-ERG3-GFP and TMPRSS2-ERG8-RFP vectors in HEK293 cells.
('localization of proteins', 'was examined by', 'microscopy')

The backbone plasmid vector was transfected into cells as a negative control.
('backbone plasmid vector', 'was transfected into', 'cells')

As expected, ERG3, which contains the DBD and NLS, was localized to the nuclear compartment of cells.
('DBD', 'was localized to', 'compartment of cells')
('NLS', 'was localized to', 'compartment of cells')

In contrast, the NLS-lacking ERG8 protein was detected in the cytoplasm (Figure ).
('ERG8 protein', 'was detected in', 'cytoplasm')

The results demonstrate that the majority of ERG3 and ERG8 proteins exhibit distinct subcellular localizations in cells.
('majority of ERG3 proteins', 'exhibit', 'localizations')

('Cell lysate separated on gel', 'was probed with', 'ERG 9FY antibody')

TM-ERG3 and TM-ERG3-GFP correspond to 53 and 79 kDa proteins, respectively.

TM-ERG8 and TM-ERG8-RFP correspond to 38 and 64 kDa proteins, respectively.

Glyceraldehyde 3- phosphate dehydrogenase, GAPDH, was used as an internal control.

ERG8 interferes with the transcriptional regulatory function of ERG3

The effect of ERG on downstream regulatory processes was examined using a reporter construct in which the mouse myocyte enhancer factor 2 (mef2c) sequence was cloned upstream of the luciferase gene.
('effect of ERG', 'was examined using', 'reporter construct')

Cells were transfected with the luciferase construct alone and also in combination with wt-ERG3, TMPRSS2-ERG3, or TMPRSS2-ERG8.
('Cells', 'were transfected with', 'luciferase construct')

A mutant TMPRSS2-ERG3 construct, containing an inactivating N-terminal +1 frame shift mutation, served as a negative control.
('construct containing +1 frame shift mutation', 'served as', 'control')

While cells transfected with reporter construct by itself showed baseline luciferase activity, co-transfection with either the wtERG3 or TMPRSS2-ERG3 activated the transcription mediated by the mef2c reporter.
('cells transfected with reporter construct', 'showed', 'baseline luciferase activity')

Transfection with either TMPRSS2-ERG8 or mutTMPRSS2-ERG3, on the other hand, did not lead to an increase of luciferase activity (Figure ).
('Transfection', 'did not lead to', 'increase of luciferase activity')

Considering the presence of multiple TMPRSS2-ERG transcriptional variants in human prostate tumors, we also evaluated the effect of TMPRSS2-ERG8 on TMPRSS2-ERG3 function.

For this purpose, the expression constructs were co-transfected along with the luciferase reporter construct such that TMPRSS2- ERG3 was kept constant, while TMPRSS2-ERG8 was transfected in increasing concentrations, in HEK293 cells.

The results showed a loss of the transcriptional activator function of TMPRSS2- ERG3 with the addition of TMPRSS2-ERG8.
('results', 'showed', 'loss of activator function of TMPRSS2 ERG3')

The addition of either 20 ng or 40 ng of the TMPRSS2-ERG8 expression plasmid in the co-transfection assay exhibited around 50% reduction in luciferase activity in comparison to TM-ERG3 alone (Figure ).
('addition of ng', 'exhibited', '% reduction in luciferase activity')

This suggests that there is an interference of TMPRSS2-ERG3 mediated activation by TMPRSS2-ERG8.

Transcriptional activation of downstream targets by TMPRSS2-ERG splice variants

(A) Modulation of expression of a luciferase reporter construct containing mef2c enhancer.

The reporter construct was co-transfected with 0, 20, 40 and 80 ng of vectors expressing wtERG3, TM-ERG3, TM-ERG8 or TM-ERG3 mutant.

Each assay was repeated a minimum of 3 times.
('assay', 'was repeated', 'minimum of times')

The data from a representative experiment is presented here.

The extent of activation is presented in the form of relative luciferase activity, which increased with increasing concentrations of vector for both wtERG3 and TM-ERG3.
('extent of activation', 'is presented in', 'form of luciferase activity')

TM-ERG8 and TM-ERG3mut resulted in baseline levels of activity.

(B) Transdominant effect of TM-ERG8 on transcriptional activation mediated by TM- ERG3.

A fixed amount of luciferase reporter (40 ng) and TM-ERG3 (40 ng) were co-transfected along with an increasing amount of TM-ERG8 (0-40 ng) into HEK293 cells.

A decrease in relative luciferase activity was observed with increased TM-ERG8.

Ectopic expression of ERG8 in VCaP cells influences the endogenous level of ERG3
('expression of ERG8', 'influences', 'level of ERG3')

Next, we analyzed the effect of TMPRSS2-ERG8 expression in VCaP cells, which are known to harbor fusions involving ERG and TMPRSS2 genes.

VCaP cells were transfected with the TMPRSS2- ERG8 vector in increasing concentrations (0, 2, 4, 6 μg), along with an empty vector in order to maintain the quantity of transfected plasmid DNA constant in each sample.
('VCaP cells', 'were transfected with', 'TMPRSS2 ERG8 vector')

Results revealed that as ectopically expressed ERG8 protein levels were increased, protein level of endogenous ERG3 was decreased, as shown in immunoblot assays (Figure ).

Earlier studies from our laboratory showed that ERG3 binds to the C-MYC P2 promoter downstream elements and activates the expression of C-MYC [].

Based on this, we evaluated the effect of ERG8 on C-MYC expression in VCaP cells.

The results showed that C-MYC protein level also exhibited a decreasing trend similar to ERG3 protein level.
('protein level', 'exhibited', 'trend')

The quantitation of signals in the immunoblot by Odyssey software, revealed the following: i) There was an increase in TMPRSS2-ERG8 expression corresponding to the amount of DNA transfected; ii) The endogenous TMPRSS2- ERG3 registered a 32% decrease in protein level in cells transfected with 6 μg of TMPRSS2- ERG8 DNA.; iii) The endogenous C-MYC showed a trend similar (38% decrease) to that of endogenous TMPRSS2-ERG3.
('quantitation of signals', 'revealed', 'following')

Furthermore, the analysis at the RNA level by qPCR showed that both TMPRSS2-ERG3 and C-MYC remained unchanged, suggesting the modulation by TMPRSS2-ERG8 is at the protein level (Figure ).
('modulation', 'is at', 'protein level')

Effect of ectopic expression of TMPRSS2-ERG8 in prostate cancer derived VCaP cells

(A) Ectopic expression of TM-ERG8 affects the level of endogenous TM-ERG3 and C- MYC proteins in VCaP cells.
('A expression', 'affects', 'level')

Cells were transfected with different amounts of TM-ERG8 as indicated, lysed, and analyzed for protein expression of TM-ERG3 and C-MYC.
('Cells', 'were transfected with', 'amounts')

Signals detected were quantitated using Odyssey software (data not shown).
('Signals detected', 'were quantitated using', 'Odyssey software')

A decrease in endogenous TM- ERG3 protein and C-MYC protein was evident with the expression of TM-ERG8.
('decrease in TM', 'was evident with', 'expression')

The experiment was repeated three times.

(B) Analysis of the effect of TM-ERG8 on endogenous TM-ERG3 and C-MYC at the RNA level.

Quantitative RT-PCR was performed using RNA from VCaP cells transfected with TM-ERG8.

Both TM-ERG3 and C-MYC remained at baseline levels of expression.

Bimolecular fluorescence complementation assay shows interaction between splice variants
('fluorescence complementation assay', 'shows', 'interaction between splice variants')

To address the underlying basis for the interference of TMPRSS2-ERG3 mediated functions by TMPRSS2-ERG8, we assessed the potential interaction between ERG3 and ERG8 proteins through fluorescence microscopy and flow cytometry using the bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) assay in live cells.

This assay involves a chimeric Venus protein which emits fluorescence upon dimerization in live cells (Figure ).
('assay', 'involves', 'Venus protein')

For this purpose, we generated constructs containing TMPRSS2-ERG3 and TMPRSS2-ERG8 coding sequences fused to either N- or C-terminal coding sequences of the Venus reporter (Figure ).

HIV-1 Vpr constructs were used as positive controls, as Vpr has been well characterized and shown to oligomerize [].
('Vpr constructs', 'were used as', 'controls')

As expected, we observed that VN-Vpr and VC-Vpr constructs co-transfected in HEK293 cells produced fluorescent signal, which was found to be localized in the nuclear region.
('constructs', 'produced', 'signal')

In addition, co-transfection of VN-ERG3 and VC-ERG3 resulted in fluorescence, also observed in the nucleus.

Similar results were seen for VN-ERG8 and VC-ERG8 co-transfection in which fluorescence was observed in the cytoplasm.
('fluorescence', 'was observed in', 'cytoplasm')

Furthermore, co-transfection of VN-ERG3 and VC-ERG8, as well as VC-ERG3 and VN-ERG8, resulted in fluorescent protein in the nucleus, indicating a direct interaction between protein products of the two splice variants (Figure ).

The transfection of two VN- constructs or the two VC- constructs together, as negative controls, showed no fluorescence in cells.
('transfection of constructs', 'showed', 'no fluorescence in cells')

In addition, a VN- or VC- construct transfected by itself also resulted in no fluorescence.
('construct transfected by itself', 'resulted in', 'no fluorescence')

The results from transfected cells independently analyzed by flow cytometry were consistent with the results obtained by microscopy (Figure ).
('results from cells analyzed by flow cytometry', 'were consistent with', 'results obtained by microscopy')

The Vpr positive control cell population contained 10.9% cells positive for fluorescence (Figure ).
('Vpr control cell population', 'contained', '% cells')

The positive control for ERG3 resulted in 17.9% positive cells (Figure ), and for ERG8 resulted in 5.4% positive cells (Figure ).
('control for ERG3', 'resulted in', '% cells')
('control for ERG3', 'resulted in', 'cells')

As predicted, co-transfection of VN-ERG3 and VC-ERG8, as well as VC-ERG3 and VN-ERG8, showed 10.1% and 12.7% cells positive for fluorescence, respectively (Figure ).

Negative controls displayed ≤ 0.3% base line positivity (Figure ).
('controls', 'displayed', 'base line positivity')

Thus, BiFC assay demonstrated interaction between ERG3 and ERG8 variants in live cells.

Clinicopathological analysis of patient data reveals a correlation between C-MYC and ERG3/ERG8 ratios
('analysis of patient data', 'reveals', 'correlation between ratios')

The intriguing observation that altered ERG expression can significantly affect C-MYC levels in the VCaP cells prompted us to re-examine Type I/Type II ratios and C- MYC expression from our previously published qRT-PCR data from laser capture micro- dissected (LCM) prostate cancer cells [, ].
('observation', 'prompted', 'us')
('ERG expression', 'can affect', 'levels')

Our previous report showed that increased Type I (ERG3)/Type II (ERG8) ratio is associated with a higher Gleason sum and poorly differentiated phenotype.
('Type Type ratio', 'is associated with', 'Gleason sum')

In contrast, a decrease in Type I/Type II ERG ratio was associated with favorable clinical-pathologic data [].
('decrease in Type I/Type ERG ratio', 'was associated with', 'data')

Consistent with these observations, we also noted a significant correlation between Type I/Type II ERG ratio and C-MYC mRNA levels (rho = 0.37, P = 0.013) within the same specimens (Table ).

In comparison, we also analyzed the relationship between PCA3 expression levels (a gene up-regulated in CaP patients, though not an ERG transcriptional target) and Type I/Type II ERG ratio, which did not show any correlation (rho = -0.06, P = 0.682; Table ).

We then compared the differences in ratios of Type I/Type II ERG across quartile groups of C-MYC gene expression, and found a trend in which groups with higher levels of C- MYC expression had higher Type I/Type II ERG ratios, (P = 0.0894).
('MYC expression', 'had', 'Type I/Type ERG ratios')

PCA3 analysis across quartile groups again revealed that higher gene expression levels did not correlate to higher Type I/Type II ERG ratio (P = 0.842).
('gene expression levels', 'did not correlate to', 'Type I/Type ERG ratio')

Further, from a biological standpoint, we compared the Type I/Type II ERG ratio between down-regulated C-MYC (&lt;0.5 fold) vs. up-regulated C-MYC (&gt;2 fold).

This analysis showed that up-regulated C-MYC had higher Type I/Type II ERG ratio compared to down-regulated C-MYC which shifted even closer towards significance (P = 0.056; Table ).

P &lt; 0.05 was considered significant.

As C-MYC gene expression is found to be down-regulated in CaP patients, Type I/II ERG ratio is low.

When C-MYC gene expression is up-regulated in CaP patients, Type I/II ERG ratio is found to be high.

DISCUSSION

Genomic rearrangements of oncogenes are established features in several human cancers and have been recognized for decades [, , ].
('rearrangements of oncogenes', 'are established', 'features in cancers')
('rearrangements of oncogenes', 'have been recognized for', 'decades')

The involvement of fusion genes in prostate cancer has been defined by Tomlins et al.
('involvement of fusion genes', 'has been defined by', 'Tomlins et al.')

[] and consistently reported by others [, , -, ].

The fusion between androgen regulated TMPRSS2 and ERG genes is present in ~50% of prostate cancer patients in Western countries [, , , , ].
('fusion between androgen TMPRSS2', 'is present in', '% of prostate cancer patients in countries')

Analysis of fusion gene transcripts from prostate cancer patients by several investigators has shown the presence of multiple forms containing varying lengths of TMPRSS2 (promoter and exon 1 and 2) and ERG.
('Analysis of fusion gene transcripts from prostate cancer patients', 'has shown', 'presence of forms containing lengths of TMPRSS2')

The predominant form noted involves the fusion of TMPRSS2 exon 1 and ERG exon 4 (Tomlins nomenclature)/exon 8 (Owczarek nomenclature) [, , ].

Recent studies have shown that TMPRSS2-ERG expression is associated with an aggressive CaP phenotype [, ] while others noted that splice variants exhibit varied level of transforming activity [].
('splice variants', 'exhibit', 'level of activity')
('expression', 'is associated with', 'CaP phenotype')

Interestingly, the splice variants have been suggested to play both a positive and negative role in the prognosis of CaP [, ].
('splice variants', 'have been suggested to play', 'role')

In addition, Wang et al. showed that the presence of the various isoforms led to increased proliferation/invasion, while knockdown led to decreased ectopic tumor size [].
('presence of isoforms', 'led to', 'proliferation/invasion')
('knockdown', 'led to', 'tumor size')

However, the functional significance of the individual transcripts, as well as their effect on each other, was not evaluated.

Here, we have characterized the most prevalent prototypic fusion transcripts (TMPRSS2-ERG3 and TMPRSS2-ERG8) that were originally identified in our previous report [].

As a prelude to functional evaluation, we initially characterized the synthesis and subcellular localization of the proteins encoded by TMPRSS2-ERG3 and TMPRSS2-ERG8.

The proteins exhibited distinct subcellular localization; ERG3 localized predominantly in the nucleus and ERG8 exhibited cytoplasmic distribution.
('proteins', 'exhibited', 'localization')

These distinct biological properties substantiated that TMPRSS2-ERG3 and TMPRSS2-ERG8 were appropriate fusion variants for investigating the functional significance of splice variants, as well as examining their influence on one another.

The transcriptional regulatory function of proteins encoded by these splice variants was explored through use of the enhancer from the mouse mef2c gene which has been shown to be active in the vascular endothelium during embryogenesis [] and in adulthood where endogenous ERG protein is highly expressed [, , ].
('function of proteins encoded by splice variants', 'was explored through', 'use of enhancer')

We utilized the mef2c vascular endothelial enhancer sequence, containing a cluster of four conserved binding sites for ETS factors, linked to the luciferase reporter, to assess the transcriptional regulatory function of ERG splice variants.

Both full length (wtERG3) and the N-terminus truncated Type I ERG protein (TMPRSS2-ERG3) activated the transcription from the mef2c driven luciferase reporter construct in HEK293 cells.
('length', 'activated', 'transcription from mef2c luciferase reporter construct')

Consistent with the absence of the NLS in the Type II ERG product, the ERG8 protein did not alter the basal promoter activity of the reporter.
('ERG8 protein', 'did not alter', 'promoter activity of reporter')

However, co-expression of TMPRSS2-ERG3 and increasing concentrations of TMPRSS2-ERG8 expression vectors showed an inhibition of TMPRSS2-ERG3-mediated activation of the mef2c reporter.

The results suggested that TMPRSS2-ERG exhibited a dominant negative effect on the function mediated by TMPRSS2-ERG.

Based on these findings, we then used VCaP cells which express both TMPRSS2-ERG variants, allowing us to carry out studies mimicking the in vivo context of prostate tumors.

Specifically, these cells express high levels of TMPRSS2-ERG8 (copy number) in comparison to TMPRSS2-ERG3 and also respond to androgens.
('cells', 'express', 'levels')
('cells', 'respond to', 'androgens')

Hence, introduction of exogenous TMPRSS2- ERG8 into VCaP cells enabled us to assess its effect on the endogenous ERG3 level.
('introduction of TMPRSS2', 'enabled to assess', 'us')

An increase in expression of ERG8 resulted in a decrease in endogenous ERG3 protein in VCaP cells.
('increase in expression of ERG8', 'resulted in', 'decrease in ERG3 protein in VCaP cells')

Remarkably, C-MYC protein levels mirrored the decrease in ERG3 protein levels.
('protein levels', 'mirrored', 'decrease in ERG3 protein levels')

Based on this, we suggest that ERG3, a transcriptional activator of C-MYC, is concomitantly regulated by ERG8.

Interestingly, while an alteration at the protein level was observed with the addition of TMPRSS2-ERG8, such an effect was not evident at the RNA level.
('effect', 'was not evident at', 'RNA level')
('alteration at protein level', 'was observed with', 'addition')

It should be noted that ERG8 lacks the DBD and embedded NLS, but retains the SAM-pointed and protein-protein interaction domain.

Therefore, it is suggested that elevated levels of ERG8 likely result in a dominant negative effect due to dimerization-mediated quenching of functional ERG3.

This was alluded to in the analysis performed by Zammarchi et al.

[], though not explored further as to biological function.

In order to further investigate the mechanistic basis of the transdominant effect between splice variants, it was important to elucidate whether there is a direct interaction between the two isoforms.

The BiFC assay, utilizing a chimeric Venus protein, allowed us to examine this directly in live cells through fluorescence microscopy.
('BiFC assay utilizing Venus protein', 'allowed to examine', 'us')

Venus constructs that contained either the N-terminus or C-terminus coding sequences of the Venus protein, linked to either TMPRSS2- ERG3 or TMPRSS2-ERG8 coding sequences were first evaluated, as they are known to homodimerize [, ].

As expected, cells were found to fluoresce, either in the nuclear region, as in the case with TMPRSS2-ERG3 or in the cytoplasmic region, as in the case with TMPRSS2- ERG8 alone.

The extent of fluorescence positive cells upon expression of chimeric TMPRSS2- ERG3 and TMPRSS2-ERG8 supports the presence of interaction domains at the N- and C- termini of ERG3 protein.
('extent of fluorescence cells', 'supports', 'presence of interaction domains C')

When cells were co-transfected with both splice variants together, we again observed fluorescence in cells, indicating heterodimerization between the two splice variants in live cells.

It is interesting to note, that while the subcellular localization of Type I and Type II ERG was found to differ, heterodimers containing ERG3 and ERG8 were observed within the nuclear compartment of cells.
('heterodimers containing ERG3 ERG8', 'were observed within', 'compartment of cells')

This suggests that protein-protein interactions are likely to take place upon synthesis in the cytoplasm, after which they are transported to the nucleus.
('interactions', 'are likely to take', 'place')

As ERG8 does not contain the NLS, it is unlikely to be transported to the nucleus on its own.

Based on this observation, we envision a scenario in which both homodimers and heterodimers may exist.

Thus, it is reasonable to expect that in the context of an altered ratio containing high TMPRSS2-ERG8 over TMPRSS2-ERG3, there is a likelihood that heterodimers may predominate over the homodimers of ERG3.
('heterodimers', 'may predominate over', 'that homodimers of ERG3')

This possibility will lead to a diminished function of the TMPRSS2-ERG3 variant.
('possibility', 'will lead to', 'function of variant')

Thus, our experiments involving co-transfection of plasmids expressing TMPRSS2-ERG3 and TMPRSS2-ERG8 variants along with mef2c driven luciferase reporter construct showed a diminished activation, in comparison to cells transfected with TMPRSS2-ERG3 alone.
('experiments involving', 'showed', 'activation')

There is a possibility that heterodimers containing TMPRSS2- ERG3 and TMPRSS2-ERG8 may preferentially be subjected to degradation resulting in a decreased level of TMPRSS2-ERG3 in VCaP cells.
('heterodimers containing TMPRSS2', 'may be subjected to', 'degradation resulting in level')

However, further investigation of this is necessary.

It has been shown that C-MYC amplification increases as carcinogenesis progresses and it is strongly associated with higher histopathological grades and Gleason's scores as well as with earlier disease progression and earlier cancer death [, ].
('carcinogenesis', 'is associated with', 'grades')

C-MYC is also a known downstream target of TMPRSS2-ERG3 [, , , , ], however its relationship to Type I/II ERG ratio has not yet been examined.

We therefore explored clinical patient data specifically for the direct relation of Type I/II ERG ratio and C-MYC gene expression levels.

Indeed, it was observed that when oncogenic C-MYC was found to be up-regulated, the Type I/II ERG ratio was also high, corroborating with earlier data in which a high Gleason sum and poor overall patient prognosis were associated with an increased Type I/II ERG ratio.
('Type ERG ratio', 'was high corroborating with', 'data')
('Gleason sum', 'were associated with', 'Type ERG ratio')
('patient prognosis', 'were associated with', 'Type ERG ratio')

C-MYC levels would also be increased in this scenario, which could be involved in progression of the disease state.
('levels', 'would be increased in', 'scenario')

The results of this analysis represent a case for the use of the ratio of Type I/Type II ERG, in conjunction with C-MYC gene expression levels, to serve as potential prognostic markers for treatment of prostate cancer patients.
('results of analysis', 'represent', 'case for use of ratio of Type I/Type ERG to serve as markers for treatment of prostate cancer patients')

Based on these findings we propose a mechanistic model in which Type II ERG (TMPRESS2-ERG8) regulates the activity of Type I ERG (TMPRSS2-ERG3), in a dominant negative manner (Figure ).
('Type ERG', 'regulates', 'activity of Type ERG')

As TMPRSS2-ERG8 is increased, TMPRSS2-ERG3 is decreased and the downstream events regulated by TMPRSS2-ERG3 are also likely inhibited.

This scenario is also supported by the data on C-MYC, which has been shown as a regulatory target of TMPRSS2- ERG3.
('scenario', 'is supported by', 'data')

In accordance with this, an increased TMPRSS2-ERG8 correlates with a lower level of both TMPRSS2-ERG3 and C-MYC.

Mechanistic model of TM-ERG splice variants

As levels of TM-ERG8 are increased, the overall ratio of Type I/Type II ERG is effectively decreased, which is associated with lower levels of C-MYC and a more favorable patient prognosis.

When levels of TM-ERG8 are lower, the Type I/II ratio is effectively higher, which is found to be associated with higher levels of C- MYC and a more aggressive form of disease in patients.

Overall, studies presented here show that the interaction between Type I and Type II splice variants of TMPRSS2-ERG present in prostate tumor tissues may lead to functional antagonism of selected variants.
('interaction between Type', 'may lead to', 'antagonism of variants')

We hypothesize that an altered ratio of high TMPRSS2-ERG8 in comparison to TMPRSS2-ERG3 may be beneficial to prostate cancer patients.
('ratio', 'may be beneficial to', 'prostate cancer patients')

The results further highlight the potential for the ratio of ERG splice variants in combination with C-MYC expression to be exploited for diagnostic and therapeutic applications against prostate cancer.
