INTRODUCTION

Aberrant RAS mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK pathway) activation is a hallmark of gliomas [].
('kinase activation', 'is', 'hallmark of gliomas')

Activation of this pathway occurs through mutations or amplifications in receptor tyrosine kinases or downstream signaling mediators such as RAS, RAF, MEK, and ERK [].
('Activation of pathway', 'occurs through', 'mutations')

Recently, a novel mechanism involving RAF fusion genes has been identified in pilocytic astrocytomas (PA) that allows for MAPK activation.
('mechanism involving RAF fusion genes', 'has been identified in', 'astrocytomas')

In-frame fusions between FAM131B and BRAF have been observed in 2% of sporadic PA [], fusions between SRGAP3 and RAF1 have also been found in 2% of sporadic PA [], and fusions between KIAA1549 and BRAF have been identified in nearly 80% of sporadic PA samples tested [–].
('fusions between FAM131B', 'have been observed in', '% of PA')
('fusions between SRGAP3', 'have been found in', '% of PA')
('fusions between SRGAP3', 'have been identified in', '% of PA samples tested')
('fusions between KIAA1549', 'have been identified in', '% of PA samples tested')

The majority (&gt;70%) of the KIAA1549:BRAF fusions occur between exon 16 of KIAA1549 and exon 9 of BRAF, but multiple different fusions have been identified [,].
('BRAF fusions', 'occur between', 'exon')

The presence of a BRAF fusion gene is now considered highly diagnostic for PA [].
('presence of BRAF fusion gene', 'is considered diagnostic for', 'PA')

These fusions cause anchorage-independent growth when overexpressed in NIH3T3 cells [,] and cerebellar neural stem cell (NSC) cultures [].
('fusions', 'cause', 'growth')

Cerebellar engraftment of NSCs expressing KIAA1549:BRAF in mice led to the formation of glioma-like lesions after a latency of 6 months [].
('BRAF in mice', 'led to', 'formation of lesions')

In each fusion the N-terminus of RAF is replaced by FAM131B, SRGAP3 or KIAA1549 resulting in loss of the N-terminal autoinhibitory domain of RAF and constitutive activation of the MAPK pathway via the retained C-terminal kinase domain (BRAF-KD) (Figure ).

The specificity with which the C-terminus of RAF fuses to these different genes suggests that it is required for tumorigenesis in this context; however, the role of the C-terminal domain of BRAF within the fusions in glioma formation has not been validated.

Expression of a BRAF kinase domain mutant carrying the V600E alteration (BRAF-KDVE) was sufficient to induce PA-like lesions in mice [].
('Expression of BRAF kinase domain', 'was sufficient to induce', 'lesions in mice')

However, in patients, the BRAF kinase domain has not been found to be mutated in this manner in the context of a fusion gene.
('BRAF kinase domain', 'has not been found to be mutated in', 'manner')

V600E mutations in full length BRAF are seen in a small percentage of PA (6%) [,–]; however, they are much more common in grade II, and high grade malignant pediatric gliomas; accounting for 18% of grade II, 33% of grade III, and 18% of grade IV tumors (23% grades II-IV) [].
('V600E mutations in length BRAF', 'are seen in', 'percentage of PA')

We have previously demonstrated that BRAFV600E can cooperate with Ink4a/Arf loss to induce high-grade gliomas in mice [].

The development of small molecule serine-threonine kinase inhibitors (vemurafenib and dabrafenib) that specifically target mutant BRAF has revolutionized the treatment of melanoma, and clinical trials are underway for treatment of pediatric gliomas carrying the BRAFV600E mutation (NCT01748149, NCT02034110).
('development of molecule kinase inhibitors', 'has revolutionized', 'treatment of melanoma')
('development of molecule kinase inhibitors', 'are', 'underway for treatment of gliomas carrying BRAFV600E mutation')
('trials', 'are', 'underway for treatment of gliomas carrying BRAFV600E mutation')

However, paradoxically these inhibitors activate MAPK signaling in tumors that do not carry codon 600 mutations, and new small molecule inhibitors designed to break this paradox do not inhibit BRAF fusion mutants at physiologically relevant doses [].
('inhibitors', 'activate', 'MAPK signaling in tumors')
('inhibitors', 'do not inhibit', 'BRAF fusion mutants')
('molecule inhibitors designed to break paradox', 'do not inhibit', 'BRAF fusion mutants')

Furthermore, mutations causing the truncation and loss of the BRAF autoregulatory domain are known to drive resistance to small molecule inhibitors that target the oncogenic codon 600 mutations [].
('mutations causing truncation loss', 'are known to drive', 'resistance to molecule inhibitors')

In addition to constitutive MAPK activity, mutations targeting the p53/Rb cell cycle pathways are also seen in gliomas.
('mutations targeting p53/Rb cell cycle pathways', 'are seen in', 'gliomas')

In PA, loss of p16 correlates strongly with reduced senescence, increased cell division, and tumor progression [,].
('loss of p16', 'increased', 'cell division')

Higher grade pediatric gliomas demonstrate constitutive MAPK activity, but this is almost always accompanied by homozygous deletion of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2A (CDKN2A) locus [].
('grade gliomas', 'demonstrate', 'MAPK activity')

This locus encodes both p16 (INK4a) and p14 (ARF) [,].
('locus', 'encodes', 'p16 p14')

p16 functions to inhibit CDK4/6 mediated phosphorylation of the Retinoblastoma (Rb) protein, and its loss allows for unregulated cell division [].
('p16 functions to inhibit CDK4/6 phosphorylation of Retinoblastoma protein', 'allows for', 'cell division')
('loss', 'allows for', 'cell division')

Loss of p14 leads to increased ubiquitination and destruction of p53 by HDM2 [].
('Loss of p14', 'leads to', 'ubiquitination')

Interestingly, 38.5% of PAs show loss of heterozygosity at 9q21, the location of the CDKN2A locus and homozygous deletion is seen in 6.4% of cases [].
('loss of heterozygosity', 'is seen in', '% of cases')

A follow-up study of PA patients receiving adjuvant therapy after surgery also found 14% of cases had both p16 loss and BRAF rearrangements [].

In the current study, we used the well-established RCAS/TVA glioma mouse model to assess the role of the BRAF-KD in glioma development in vivo.

We show that although the BRAF-KD is not tumorigenic on its own, cooperation with Ink4a/Arf loss leads to the development of relatively indolent but highly atypical and cellular gliomas in vivo.
('cooperation with loss', 'leads to', 'development of gliomas')

RESULTS

The BRAF kinase domain promotes anchorage-independent growth
('BRAF kinase domain', 'promotes', 'growth')

We previously demonstrated the transformative capacity of N-TVA/Ink4a/Arf−/− astrocytes infected with RCASBP(A) viruses containing CRAFß22W, BRAFV600E or KRASG12D, which form numerous colonies in soft agar [].

To assess the transforming potential of the BRAF kinase domain BRAF-KD, we infected N-TVA/Ink4a/Arf−/− astrocytes with RCASBP(A)BRAF-KD and the full length BRAF with the V600E mutation, RCASBP(A)BRAFV600E (hereafter BRAF-FLVE).

Gene delivery and expression was confirmed by immunoblotting (Figure ).
('Gene delivery', 'was confirmed by', 'immunoblotting')
('expression', 'was confirmed by', 'immunoblotting')

Analysis of phosphorylated Erk 1/2 (P-Erk) demonstrated elevated MAPK activation in cells expressing BRAF-KD (Figure ).
('Analysis of phosphorylated', 'demonstrated', 'MAPK activation in cells expressing')

Ink4a/Arf-deficient astrocytes expressing BRAF-KD or BRAF-FLVE proliferated more rapidly than the negative control; however, there was no significant difference between proliferation of BRAF-KD or BRAF-FLVE cells (P=0.29; Figure ).

Whereas Ink4a/Arf-deficient astrocytes did not form colonies in soft agar, expression of BRAF-KD or our positive control BRAF-FLVE, induced colonies demonstrating their ability to transform cells in the context of altered Rb and/or p53 signaling (Figure ).
('astrocytes', 'did not form', 'colonies')
('expression', 'induced', 'colonies')

Interestingly, there was a statistically significant difference between the number of colonies formed by BRAF-KD and BRAF-FLVE expression (P=0.04).

The BRAF-kinase domain promotes transformation and tumor growth in vivo
('domain', 'promotes', 'transformation tumor growth')

A more stringent assay of tumorigenic potential is the ability to form tumors in vivo.
('assay of potential', 'is', 'ability to form tumors')

The cell lines used for these orthotopic studies are syngeneic with the immunocompetent host mouse strain.
('cell lines used for studies', 'are syngeneic with', 'host mouse strain')

Therefore, to assess tumorigenicity in vivo, 2 × 104 astrocytes were delivered intracranially to newborn mice, and the mice were monitored for signs of tumor formation.
('x astrocytes', 'were monitored for', 'signs of tumor formation')
('mice', 'were monitored for', 'signs of tumor formation')

Ink4a/Arf-deficient astrocytes expressing mutant KRAS served as a positive control.
('astrocytes expressing KRAS', 'served as', 'control')

Tumors formed within 3 weeks in 100% of mice injected with Ink4a/Arf-deficient astrocytes expressing KRASG12D (8/8) or the BRAF-KD (8/8).
('Tumors', 'formed within', 'weeks')

No tumors formed following the injection of uninfected astrocytes within this time frame.

Histologically, the BRAF-KD tumors resembled highly cellular and invasive gliomas; both possessed a diffuse growth pattern but lacked the necrosis and endothelial hyperplasia typical of grade IV tumors, glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) (H&amp;E; ).
('Histologically', 'possessed', 'growth pattern')
('tumors', 'resembled', 'gliomas')

Expression of the BRAF-KD was confirmed using IHC for the HA epitope Tag (HA; ).
('Expression', 'was confirmed using', 'IHC')

MAPK pathway activation within the tumors was assessed using IHC for P-Erk (P-Erk; ).
('MAPK pathway activation within tumors', 'was assessed using', 'IHC')

All the tumors expressed the glial progenitor marker Nestin; however, expression of the glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) was absent (GFAP, ).
('tumors', 'expressed', 'progenitor marker Nestin')

Expression of the BRAF-KD in combination with Ink4a/Arf loss induces gliomas in mice
('Expression', 'induces', 'gliomas in mice')

The RCAS/TVA system allows us to deliver genes to somatic Nestin-TVA cells in vivo.
('RCAS/TVA system', 'allows to deliver', 'us')

This enables determination of the roles of specific genes in glioma initiation and progression.

Using this system we previously validated the role of mutant BRAF and canonical MAPK signaling in glioma development and maintenance.

We found that intracranial infection of newborn N-TVA/Ink4a/Arflox/lox mice with RCASBP(A) viruses containing BRAF-FLVE, KRASG12D or gain of function MEK (MEKGF) in combination with Cre leads to the development of high grade gliomas of various subtypes and morphologies [,].
('infection', 'leads to', 'development of grade gliomas of subtypes')

Here, we set out to determine if the BRAF-KD is sufficient to induce gliomas in vivo alone or in combination with Ink4a/Arf loss.

Newborn N-TVA/Ink4a/Arflox/lox mice were infected intracranially with RCASBP(A) virus containing BRAF-KD and/or Cre and survival was assessed over a 12 week period.
('A virus containing', 'was assessed over', 'period')

All mice infected with RCASBP(A) viruses containing BRAF-KD (12/12), Cre (30/30) or BRAF-KD + Cre (29/29) survived the 12-week experimental period.
('mice infected with RCASBP viruses containing', 'survived', 'period')

Brain tissue from all injected mice was analyzed histologically.

None of the mice infected with RCASBP(A) viruses containing BRAF-KD or Cre alone developed tumors; however, gliomas were detected in 21% (6/29) of mice injected with RCASBP(A) viruses containing BRAF-KD and Cre (Figure ).
('None of mice infected with RCASBP viruses containing', 'developed', 'tumors')
('gliomas', 'were detected in', '%')

This incidence is not statically different (P=0.15) from our previously published experiments where 38% (10/26) of mice injected with full length BRAFV600E and Cre viruses developed tumors; however, the mice with BRAF-FLVE-induced tumors had to be sacrificed before 12 weeks due to tumor burden [] whereas the BRAF-KD mice demonstrated no obvious symptoms (Figure ).
('mice with tumors', 'had to be sacrificed before', 'weeks')
('mice', 'demonstrated', 'no symptoms')

Histologic analysis of the brains from the BRAF-KD cohort revealed the presence of tumors, which suggests a distinct progression from the BRAFV600E-induced tumors.
('analysis of brains from cohort', 'revealed', 'presence of tumors')

The stark difference in the posthoc survival analysis of tumor-bearing BRAF-KD and BRAF-FLVE mice (P&lt;0.001) as well as the lower level of P-Erk1 and P-Erk2 (P&lt;0.001) in astrocytes expressing BRAF-KD compared to BRAF-FLVE suggests that the BRAF-KD tumors are less malignant gliomas (Figure ).
('tumors', 'are', 'gliomas')

Data are represented as mean ± S.E.M of six replicates, of which two are shown in the western blot.
('two', 'are shown in', 'western blot')

Histologically, the BRAF-KD Ink4a/Arf−/− tumors were highly cellular with atypical nuclei and mitoses, similar to the BRAF-FLVE-induced tumors.
('Histologically', 'were cellular with', 'nuclei')

In contrast to the BRAF-FLVE-induced tumors, the BRAF-KD–induced tumors showed a more circumscribed, less invasive border.
('tumors', 'showed', 'border')

Furthermore, the BRAF-KD-induced tumors had a lower mitotic index compared to BRAF-FLVE-induced tumors (Figure ) [].
('tumors', 'had', 'index compared to tumors')

Immunostaining for the cellular proliferation marker Ki-67 demonstrated generally lower cellular proliferation in BRAF-KD tumors compared to BRAF-FLVE tumors which were consistently highly proliferative ().

('Tumor A', 'is', 'representative of tumors')

('IHC sections', 'were counterstained with', 'hematoxylin')

Scale bar represents 200μm.
('Scale bar', 'represents', '200mm')

Similar to the BRAF-FLVE-induced tumors, there was considerable heterogeneity between tumors within the same sections; some were comprised mainly of spindle cells while others were predominantly epithelioid.

Several tumors also contained populations of giant tumor cells (Figure ).
('tumors', 'contained', 'populations of tumor cells')

Immunostaining using a C-terminal antibody for BRAF and for the HA-epitope tag confirmed expression of virally delivered BRAF-KD.
('Immunostaining using antibody for BRAF', 'confirmed', 'expression')
('for', 'confirmed', 'expression')

All of the tumors expressed Nestin, and GFAP expression was present in several smaller tumors (Figure ).
('Nestin', 'was present in', 'tumors')
('GFAP expression', 'was present in', 'tumors')

Together, the lower mitotic index, the lower MAPK activation, and the more circumscribed tumor borders may explain the lack of symptoms observed in these mice at 12 weeks post-injection as compared to BRAF-FLVE-induced tumors.
('index', 'may explain', 'lack of symptoms observed in mice')
('tumor borders', 'may explain', 'lack of symptoms observed in mice')

These distinct features suggest that the tumors driven by BRAF-KD have a later onset or more indolent behavior than tumors driven by BRAFV600E [].
('tumors driven', 'have', 'onset behavior')

MEK and PI3K/mTOR inhibition reduces proliferation and induces significant apoptosis in cells expressing the BRAF-KD
('MEK inhibition', 'reduces', 'proliferation')
('MEK inhibition', 'induces', 'apoptosis')

Type 1 BRAFV600E mutant inhibitors (vemurafenib, dabrafenib) have been demonstrated to cause paradoxical activation of the MAPK pathway in cells expressing the BRAF-KD fusions [].
('Type BRAFV600E mutant inhibitors', 'have been demonstrated to cause', 'activation of MAPK pathway')

Since activating mutations in BRAF drive cell growth and proliferation primarily through canonical MAPK signaling (e.g., BRAF-MEK– ERK), we chose to test the effect of Mek inhibition on the growth of cell lines driven by BRAF-FLVE and BRAF-KD.

The concentration required for the inhibition of Erk phosphorylation with the Mek inhibitor PD0325901 (hereafter 901) in N-TVA;Ink4a/Arf−/− astrocytes expressing BRAF-FLVE and BRAF-KD, was determined by titration using 100 nmol/L and 1 μmol/L of 901.

Treatment with 0.1μM significantly reduced Erk1/2 phosphorylation and 1 μM of the Mek inhibitor was sufficient for complete blockade (Figure ).
('Treatment with mM', 'reduced', 'Erk1/2 phosphorylation mM')

As expected, we observed a negative-feedback loop between Mek and PI3K signaling – evidenced by the increasing levels of P-Akt with increasing Mek inhibition []; therefore, we also targeted PI3K/mTOR signaling using 1 μmol/l of the PI3K/mTOR inhibitor NVP-BEZ235 (hereafter; BEZ).

The proliferation of Ink4a/Arf−/− astrocytes expressing BRAF-FLVE and BRAF-KD was significantly inhibited by both 901 and BEZ.
('proliferation of Ink4a/Arf', 'was inhibited by', '901')

Combined treatment with 901 and BEZ produced an additive effect (S=1.2, P=0.0633) in the context of the BRAF-KD and synergistic effect in the context of BRAFV600E (S= 0.516, P=0.0001) as assessed by reduction in cell growth over 96 hours with synergy and additivity calculations performed as described previously (Figure ) [].
('treatment with 901', 'produced', 'effect')
('BEZ', 'produced', 'effect')

A significant increase in apoptosis in BRAFV600E and BRAF-KD cells was also observed (Figure ).

DISCUSSION

While the role of the N-terminal segment within BRAF fusion genes (i.e. KIAA1549, SRGAP3, FAM131b) is unknown, there is evidence to suggest their possible function.

SRGAP3 has been proposed to play a role in neurogenesis [] and contains a Fes/CIP4 Homology (FCH) domain, which has a putative function in regulating the microtubule cytoskeleton [].

KIAA1549 harbors two transmembrane domains, which have been proposed to tether RAF to the membrane.

However, the minimal FAM131b fusion component is only 9 amino acids in size and has no known or predicted function [].
('FAM131b fusion component', 'is', 'amino acids in size')

Our results demonstrate that the BRAF-KD alone can cooperate with Ink4a/Arf loss to drive gliomagenesis in vivo.

Deletion of the N-terminal auto-inhibitory domain allows activation of the protein at sufficient levels to drive tumorigenesis.
('Deletion of domain', 'allows', 'activation of protein')

We suspect that the transforming capabilities of the various BRAF fusion genes lies within the BRAF-KD, and the promoters of FAM131b, SRGAP3, and KIAA1549 simply serve to direct expression to the appropriate cells in the brain.
('capabilities of BRAF fusion genes', 'serve to direct', 'expression')
('promoters of FAM131b', 'serve to direct', 'expression')

Thus, the result of the rearrangements is the loss of the regulatory domain leading to constitutive MAPK activation, a phenomenon that is observed in 80-90% of PAs [].
('result of rearrangements', 'is', 'loss of domain leading to MAPK activation')

While it has been shown before that BRAF-KDVE can form lesions in mice resembling PA [], BRAF fusion genes in humans do not harbor the V600E mutation.
('BRAF fusion genes in humans', 'do not harbor', 'V600E mutation')

To our knowledge, this is the first report to show that BRAF-KD can lead to glioma development in cooperation with Ink4a/Arf loss.

Expression of a powerful oncogene, such as BRAFV600E in otherwise normal cells can prevent proliferation by inducing senescence; this phenomenon, referred to as ‘Oncogene Induced Senescence’ (OIS), is especially common in melanoma where it prevents the progression of benign nevi with BRAFV600E mutations into melanoma [].
('Expression of oncogene', 'can prevent', 'proliferation')
('Oncogene Induced Senescence', 'is common in', 'melanoma')

Loss of p16 expression is a common occurrence in melanoma and interestingly loss of p16 also correlates strongly with reduced senescence, increased cell division, and progression of PAs into WHO grade II astrocytomas [,].
('Loss of p16 expression', 'is', 'occurrence in melanoma')
('loss of p16', 'increased', 'cell division')

The BRAF-KD Ink4a/Arf−/− mice demonstrated no obvious symptoms within the 12-week experimental timeframe and survived to endpoint in contrast to the BRAF-FLVE

Ink4a/Arf−/− mice that began to die from the 3rd week.

Other distinguishing characteristics between the BRAF-KD and BRAF-FLVE include histology showing a lack of necrosis and less invasive borders as well as immunoblotting demonstrating decreased levels of MAPK activation in tumors driven by the BRAF-KD.
('characteristics', 'include', 'histology')

This suggests that the level of canonical BRAF signaling plays a role in glioma development and progression.
('level of BRAF signaling', 'plays', 'role')

Fascinatingly, expression of the full length KIAA1549:BRAF fusion protein has never been detected either in vitro or in vivo, even in KIAA1549:BRAF transgenic mice [], suggesting that sporadic PA require low levels of BRAF signaling, and that this is one way in which they may escape OIS in the context of p16 expression.
('PA', 'require', 'levels of BRAF signaling')

Hereditary melanoma–astrocytoma syndrome is characterized by a dual predisposition to melanoma and development of low-grade paediatric astrocytomas.
('melanoma', 'is characterized by', 'predisposition to melanoma')

This syndrome is associated with germline mutations that effect only CDKN2A exon 1β, resulting in loss of p14 expression but not p16 expression [].
('syndrome', 'is associated with', 'germline mutations')

For these reasons, future experiments will concentrate on determining the grade and response to treatment of tumors induced with BRAF-KD and either p16 or p14 loss.
('experiments', 'will concentrate on', 'determining grade response')

MEK inhibition in gliomas is an area of ongoing study.
('MEK inhibition in gliomas', 'is', 'area of study')

Currently, a clinical trial (NCT02124772) is underway to investigate the efficacy of treating V600E gliomas with a combination of a Trametinib and Dabrafenib.
('trial', 'is', 'underway to investigate efficacy of treating V600E gliomas')

Recently, both drugs have shown limited penetration into the brain due to active efflux across the blood-brain-barrier (BBB) [,].
('drugs', 'have shown', 'penetration')

Thus for our in vitro studies, we opted for 901 because it has been shown to penetrate the BBB [,].

In fact the toxic effects of 901 are likely due to its ability to cross the BBB.
('effects of 901', 'are likely', 'due to ability to cross BBB')

The paradoxical activation of the MAPK pathway caused by BRAFV600E inhibitors could be inhibited by dual BRAF-MEK inhibition as has been observed in melanoma, but the consequence of this is expected to be more p-AKT [].
('activation of MAPK pathway caused by BRAFV600E inhibitors', 'could be inhibited by', 'inhibition')

As proposed previously, we believe that a combination of 901 and BEZ can serve as a rational cancer therapeutic [].
('combination of 901', 'can serve as', 'cancer')
('BEZ', 'can serve as', 'cancer')

To date there have been no clinical trials studying the specific combination of BEZ and 901; however, two trials have examined the combined effect of dual inhibition MAPK and PI3K involving either BEZ or 901.
('trials', 'have examined', 'effect of inhibition MAPK involving BEZ 901')

NCT01337765 was a phase 1 trial for studying BEZ with a different MEK compound (MEK162), and NCT01347866 is a currently ongoing phase 1 trial to study 901 with another PI3K-mTOR compound (PF-05212384).

In summary, our findings demonstrate that the BRAF-KD region of the numerous BRAF fusion genes drives gliomagenesis.
('region of BRAF fusion genes', 'drives', 'gliomagenesis')

As cancers with BRAF mutations are often addicted to this signaling pathway, targeting BRAF signaling represents a reasonable therapeutic strategy.
('cancers with BRAF mutations', 'are addicted to', 'signaling pathway')

However, cells expressing KIAA1549-BRAF fusions genes display paradoxical activation when they are targeted with BRAFV600E inhibitors (i.e. vemurafenib) [].
('cells expressing fusions genes', 'display', 'activation')

Unfortunately, next generation, paradox breaker BRAF inhibitors that have reduced capacity to paradoxically activate wild-type BRAF do not inhibit BRAF fusions genes at physiologically relevant doses [,].
('paradox breaker BRAF inhibitors', 'do not inhibit', 'BRAF fusions genes')

We previously demonstrated that efficacy of combined MEK and PI3K/mTOR inhibition for the treatment of high-grade gliomas driven by BRAFV600E []; our latest results suggest that combined MEK and PI3K/mTOR inhibition is a rational therapy for the treatment of gliomas driven by fusion genes containing the BRAF-KD as well.

METHODS

Mice and genotyping

Nestin-TVA;Ink4a/Arflox/lox mice and genotyping procedures have been described [].

The mice are on a mixed genetic background consisting of FVB/n, 129, and C57Bl/6.
