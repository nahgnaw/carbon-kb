INTRODUCTION

Malignant mesothelioma (MM) is an aggressive malignancy related to asbestos exposure ().
('mesothelioma', 'is', 'malignancy')

The disease, which is responsible for the deaths of 3000 Americans annually (), has a lengthy latency phase, sometimes 20 to 30 years subsequent to exposure.

For the majority of patients afflicted with mesothelioma, systemic therapy remains the only choice of treatment.

In terms of single-agent therapy, a wide variety of compounds from many different drug families have been tested against MM with overall response rates ranging from 10-30%.
('variety of compounds', 'have been tested against', 'MM')

Currently, the standard of care for MM is combination therapy with cisplatin and pemetrexed.
('standard of care', 'is', 'combination therapy with cisplatin')

This therapeutic combination leads to an overall response rate of 41% (), median time to progression of 7 months, and overall survival of 12 months ().
('combination', 'leads to', 'response rate of %')

There is no recognized standard of care for second-line therapy.

Therefore, it is important to develop new therapeutic targets and interventions to treat patients with this deadly disease.

Tripterygium wilfordii is a Chinese medicinal herb that has been used for centuries to treat inflammatory and autoimmune diseases (-).
('Tripterygium wilfordii', 'is', 'herb')

Triptolide, a diterpenoid triepoxide, is one of more than 100 components that have been isolated from T. wilfordii.

The first report of triptolide's immunosuppressive and anticancer properties appeared in 1972 ().
('report of properties', 'appeared in', '1972')

Since then, triptolide has been shown to inhibit proliferation and induce apoptosis of many cancer types in vitro and prevent tumor growth in vivo (, -).
('triptolide', 'has been shown to inhibit', 'proliferation')

The precise mechanism of how triptolide kills cancer cells is unknown.
('triptolide', 'kills', 'cancer cells')

However, recent studies have shown that triptolide mediates cancer cell death by inhibiting expression of a member of the heat shock protein family, Hsp70 (heat shock protein 70) ().
('triptolide', 'mediates', 'cancer cell death')

Hsp70 is aberrantly expressed in several human malignancies and its inhibition kills cancer cells ().
('inhibition', 'kills', 'cancer cells')

In addition, Hsp70 expression is elevated in both pancreatic cancer and osteosarcoma compared to normal cells, and treatement with triptolide or minnelide, a water-soluble prodrug of triptolide, decreases Hsp70 expression and induces apoptosis and cell death in preclinical studies (, ).
('Hsp70 expression', 'is elevated in', 'cancer')
('Hsp70 expression', 'decreases', 'Hsp70 expression')
('treatement with triptolide', 'decreases', 'Hsp70 expression')
('treatement with triptolide', 'induces', 'apoptosis cell death')

Furthermore, triptolide reduces Hsp70 expression and inhibits cancer cell proliferation in neuroblastoma (, ).
('triptolide', 'reduces', 'Hsp70 expression')
('triptolide', 'inhibits', 'cancer cell proliferation')

Elevated levels of Hsp70 are also implicated in increased resistance of MM cells to chemotherapeutic drugs (-).
('levels of Hsp70', 'are implicated in', 'resistance of MM cells')

These studies suggest that Hsp70 may be a potentially important therapeutic target for mesothelioma.

The use of triptolide in animal models has been restricted because of its poor solubility in aqueous medium ().

Therefore, a water-soluble prodrug of triptolide named minnelide was developed.

To date, investigations have demonstrated that minnelide inhibits growth of xenografts of non-small cell lung cancer (), osteosarcoma (), and pancreatic cancer ().
('minnelide', 'inhibits', 'growth of xenografts of cell lung cancer osteosarcoma')

In this study, minnelide was assessed as a therapeutic agent against mesothelioma.
('minnelide', 'was assessed as', 'agent against mesothelioma')

Mesothelioma cell viability was reduced and apoptosis induced by minnelide and triptolide.

Triptolide treatment sensitized cells to pemetrexed and gemcitabine.

Triptolide exposure decreased cellular levels of Hsp70 in a dose-dependent manner.
('Triptolide exposure', 'decreased', 'levels of Hsp70')

Importantly, intraperitoneal delivery of minnelide into mice bearing MM xenografts significantly suppressed tumor growth.
('delivery of minnelide', 'suppressed', 'tumor growth')

These preclinical studies support the clinical development of minnelide as a novel agent for mesothelioma therapy.
('studies', 'support', 'development of minnelide')

RESULTS

Triptolide and the prodrug minnelide repress mesothelioma proliferation
('Triptolide', 'repress', 'mesothelioma proliferation')
('prodrug minnelide', 'repress', 'mesothelioma proliferation')

Previous research revealed that triptolide and its prodrug minnelide inhibited proliferation in a wide variety of cancer types (, -, , , ).
('triptolide', 'inhibited', 'proliferation')
('prodrug minnelide', 'inhibited', 'proliferation')

To investigate whether triptolide and minnelide inhibit proliferation in mesothelioma, we treated four MM cell lines with both drugs and assessed cell survival.
('triptolide', 'inhibit', 'proliferation in mesothelioma')
('minnelide', 'inhibit', 'proliferation in mesothelioma')

At a concentration of 100 nM, both drugs significantly reduced cell viability to less than 11% of untreated control (Fig. ). The prodrug minnelide was roughly as potent as the active compound triptolide.
('drugs', 'reduced', 'cell viability')

Two different mesothelioma subtypes were included in this study, epitheliod (H2461) and sarcomatoid (H2373 and H2596), revealing that both minnelide and triptolide are equally effective against both mesothelioma subtypes.
('minnelide', 'are effective against', 'mesothelioma subtypes')
('triptolide', 'are effective against', 'mesothelioma subtypes')
('mesothelioma subtypes', 'were included in', 'study epitheliod sarcomatoid')

To elucidate the IC 50 of triptolide in MM cells, the least (H513) and most (H2373) sensitive cell lines were treated with a range of drug concentrations.

The IC 50 for H513 and H2373 was 6.28 and 4.24 nM, respectively.

These values are consistent with the values determined for lung cancer (), osteosarcoma (), and pancreatic cancer ().
('values', 'are consistent with', 'values determined for lung cancer')

Triptolide or minnelide treatment suppresses mesothelioma proliferation
('Triptolide treatment', 'suppresses', 'mesothelioma proliferation')

Mesothelioma cell lines H513, H2373, H2461, and H2596 were untreated or treated with 100 nM of triptolide (A) or minnelide (B).
('Mesothelioma cell lines', 'treated with', 'nM of triptolide')

For dose response analysis, H513 and H2373 cell lines were untreated or treated with the indicated concentrations of triptolide.

Viable cells were counted 72 hours after treatment.
('cells', 'were counted', 'hours')

For minnelide treatment, antarctic phosphatase (2 units/mL) was present in the medium for the bioconversion of minnelide to the active compound triptolide (B).
('phosphatase', 'was present in', 'medium for bioconversion of minnelide')

DMSO (0.2%) was present in all treatments containing triptolide (A, C).
('DMSO', 'was present in', 'treatments containing triptolide')

Data represent the mean (Â± SD) of three independent determinations of cell number normalized to untreated cells (A, B).
('Data', 'represent', 'mean')

Asterisks indicate a significant difference in cell viability (p &lt; 0.05) between treated and untreated cells.
('Asterisks', 'indicate', 'difference in cell viability')

Triptolide treatment diminishes Hsp70 protein levels
('Triptolide treatment', 'diminishes', 'protein levels')

Triptolide has been shown to reduce Hsp70 expression in pancreatic cancer and neuroblastoma (, ).
('Triptolide', 'has been shown to reduce', 'Hsp70 expression in cancer')

To determine whether the malignant phenotype of mesothelioma is in part driven by overexpression of Hsp70, we examined steady-state levels of Hsp70.

In a panel of MM cell lines, protein band density measurement following immunoblot analysis revealed that expression of Hsp70 was substantially increased compared to non-transformed human mesothelial cells (LP9) (Figure ).
('expression of Hsp70', 'was increased compared', 'to')

The mean increase for the MM cell lines was 2.4 fold (range 1.55-2.81).
('increase for MM cell lines', 'was', 'fold')

We next assessed whether triptolide exposure affects Hsp70 expression.
('triptolide exposure', 'affects', 'Hsp70 expression')

MM cells were treated with increasing doses of triptolide for 48 hours and lysates prepared (Figure ).
('MM cells', 'were treated with', 'doses of triptolide')

Three of the four MM cell lines exhibited decreased Hsp70 protein levels in a subtypes.
('Three of MM cell lines', 'exhibited', 'Hsp70 protein levels in subtypes')

To elucidate the IC of triptolide in MM cells, dose-dependent fashion.

There was a modest increase in Hsp70 at the lowest dose used (31.24 nM).

This initial increase in Hsp70 level after low-dose triptolide treatment may be a stress response of drug treatment as has been seen previously in mesothelioma (, ) and other cancers ().
('increase in Hsp70 level', 'be', 'stress response of drug treatment')

H2461 cells displayed a boost in Hsp70 at triptolide concentrations of 31.25 and 62.5 nM followed by a reduction in levels at the highest doses.
('H2461 cells', 'displayed', 'boost in Hsp70')

In addition, baseline Hsp70 levels were greatest for H2461 cells compared to other MM cell lines (Figure ).
('baseline Hsp70 levels', 'were greatest for', 'H2461 cells')

Together, these data show that at higher triptolide doses Hsp70 expression decreases substantially, in three of four MM cell lines, compared to untreated and low-dose treatment.

Apoptosis is induced by triptolide and minnelide in mesothelioma
('Apoptosis', 'is induced by', 'triptolide')

Hsp70 upregulation can confer resistance to apoptosis (, ).
('Hsp70 upregulation', 'can confer', 'resistance')

We explored the possibility that suppression of Hsp70 levels by triptolide and minnelide treatment would lead to apoptotic cell death in mesothelioma.
('suppression of Hsp70 levels', 'would lead to', 'cell death in mesothelioma')

Several markers of apoptosis were investigated including poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) cleavage, Annexin V staining, and caspase activity.
('markers of apoptosis', 'were investigated including', 'polymerase cleavage')

PARP cleavage was assessed in MM cells treated with triptolide or minnelide as an indicator of induction of apoptosis.
('PARP cleavage', 'was assessed in', 'MM cells treated with triptolide')

A panel of 4 MM cell lines were either treated with triptolide (125 nM) or minnelide (100 nM) or left untreated for 48 hours and lysates prepared.
('panel of MM cell lines', 'were treated with', 'triptolide')

Immunoblot analysis revealed treatment with both triptolide and minnelide led to increased PARP cleavage in MM cells signifying apoptosis as compared to untreated cells (Figure ).
('treatment with triptolide', 'led to', 'PARP cleavage in cells apoptosis')

Two cell lines were assayed for caspase 3/7 activity, which is an earlier indicator of apoptosis than PARP cleavage.
('cell lines', 'were assayed for', 'caspase activity')

H513 and H2373 exposed to 100 nM triptolide for 24, 48, and 72 hours resulted in a significant increase in caspase 3/7 activity compared to untreated cells, further linking reduced cell viability with activation of apoptosis (Figure ).

The externalization of phosphatidylserine is a consequence of apoptosis that can be measured by Annexin V staining.
('externalization of phosphatidylserine', 'is', 'consequence of apoptosis')

MM cell lines H513 and H2373 were treated with vehicle (0.2% DMSO) or 100 nM triptolide for 48 hours, and cells were then subjected to Annexin V measurement.
('MM cell lines', 'were treated with', 'vehicle')
('MM cell lines', 'were subjected to', 'Annexin V measurement')
('cells', 'were subjected to', 'Annexin V measurement')

The level of Annexin V-positive cells increased from 12.3 to 39.8% for H513 cells and from 13 to 54% for H2373 cells (Figure ).
('level of Annexin cells', 'increased from', '12.3')

On the basis of the results from these three different apoptosis assays, triptolide and minnelide are capable of inducing apoptotic cell death in mesothelioma cells.

Triptolide treatment enhances susceptibility of mesothelioma cells to cytotoxic drugs
('Triptolide treatment', 'enhances', 'susceptibility of mesothelioma cells')

To explore the possibility that triptolide treatment would also enhance chemotherapy-induced cell killing, we treated mesothelioma cell lines with pemetrexed and gemcitabine alone and in combination with triptolide.
('triptolide treatment', 'would enhance', 'cell killing')

Cell viability was reduced among all four cells lines treated for 72 hours with the combination of triptolide and pemetrexed compared to each single agent treatment (Figure ).
('Cell viability', 'was reduced among', 'cells lines treated for hours')
('Cell viability', 'pemetrexed compared', 'to')

In each case, reduced cell viability for the combined treatment was significantly different than that of each drug alone.
('cell viability for treatment', 'was different than', 'that of drug')

However, for H2461 the difference between triptolide alone and the combined treatment was not that extensive.

The addition of triptolide treatment enhanced pemetrexed-induced cell death by 30.8% [H513], 29.8% [H2373], 33.6%, [H2461], and 27.2% [H2596] as compared to cells treated with only pemetrexed.
('addition of triptolide treatment', 'enhanced', 'cell death % %')

Combination treatment with triptolide and gemcitabine also resulted in additional cytotoxicity compared to either treatment alone (Figure ).
('Combination treatment with triptolide', 'resulted in', 'cytotoxicity')

In three of the 4 cell lines studied, combined treatment resulted in cell viability that was significantly lower than either drug alone.
('treatment', 'resulted in', 'cell viability')

Further, the addition of triptolide treatment increased gemcitabine-induced cell death by 58.7% [H513], 27.6% [H2373], 37.7%, [H2461], and 45.7% [H2596] as compared to gemcitabine alone.

Minnelide potently inhibits xenograft tumor growth
('Minnelide', 'inhibits', 'xenograft tumor growth')

The promising in vitro results presented in Figure  demonstrating potent sensitivity of mesothelioma cells to minnelide along with the successful preclinical in vivo minnelide investigations (, , ) led to experiments to test the activity of minnelide against human MM in nude mouse xenografts.

MM cells were implanted in the flanks of nude mice, and five days later mice were treated with either minnelide (0.42 mg/kg mouse weight) or PBS for twenty-eight days.
('MM cells', 'were implanted in', 'flanks of mice')
('MM cells', 'were treated with', 'minnelide')
('mice', 'were treated with', 'minnelide')

Mice were sacrificed the 32nd (H2373) or 33rd (H513) day after tumor cell injection.

Intraperitoneal injections of minnelide produced substantial activity against both H513 and H2373 tumors, resulting in markedly decreased tumor progression compared to PBS-treated controls.
('injections of minnelide', 'produced', 'activity against H513')

Significantly reduced tumor volume (p&lt;0.02) at the completion of the experiment was 3.25 fold for H2373 and 7.1 fold for H513.
('tumor volume', 'was', 'fold for H2373')

The final weight of tumors from minnelide-treated xenografts was 31% (H2373) and 14.8% (H513) of the tumor weight of PBS-treated mice, respectively (p&lt;0.006).

Tumor volumes were found to be significantly different (p&lt;0.05) starting on day 18 and day 20 after tumor implantation for H2373 and H513, respectively.

Overall, these results show that when mesothelioma xenografts are treated with minnelide, tumor growth is drastically inhibited.
('mesothelioma xenografts', 'are treated with', 'minnelide')

DISCUSSION

The present study demonstrates that triptolide or minnelide treatment suppresses mesothelioma proliferation in part through suppression of Hsp70 expression and induction of apoptosis.
('triptolide treatment', 'suppresses', 'mesothelioma proliferation')

Triptolide also potentiated cell killing when combined with cytotoxic drugs.
('Triptolide', 'potentiated', 'cell killing')

Importantly, our data demonstrate that minnelide potently inhibits xenograft tumor growth.
('minnelide', 'inhibits', 'xenograft tumor growth')

These data suggest that minnelide could potentially be an effective therapy for patients with mesothelioma.
('minnelide', 'be', 'therapy for patients with mesothelioma')

Most human malignancies exhibit increased levels of Hsp70 family members, and overexpression of Hsp70 family members can indicate poor prognosis (, ).
('malignancies', 'exhibit', 'levels of Hsp70 family members')
('malignancies', 'can indicate', 'prognosis')
('overexpression of Hsp70 family members', 'can indicate', 'prognosis')

Enhanced Hsp70 levels protect cancer cells from apoptosis and cellular pressures linked to amplified growth, aneuploidy, and accumulation of mutant proteins ().
('Hsp70 levels', 'protect', 'cancer cells')

Abnormal levels of Hsp70 have been implicated in T-cell lymphoma in transgenic mice (), breast cancer cell growth (, ), and tumorigenicity of Rat-1 fibroblasts ().
('levels of Hsp70', 'have been implicated in', 'lymphoma in mice')

These studies indicate that Hsp70 is an attractive target for therapeutic intervention.

One of the means by which triptolide is believed to inhibit cancer cell growth is by repression of Hsp70 expression.
('One of means', 'is by', 'repression of Hsp70 expression')
('triptolide', 'is believed to inhibit', 'cancer cell growth')

Triptolide exposure has been shown to lead to a decrease in Hsp70 expression in pancreatic cancer (), osteosarcoma (), neuroblastoma (), and, in this study, mesothelioma.
('Triptolide exposure', 'has been shown to lead to', 'decrease in Hsp70 expression in cancer')

A recent study has revealed that the likely mechanism for the decreased levels of Hsp70 is that triptolide induces the upregulation of a microRNA, miR-142-3p, which directly binds to the 3â² UTR of Hsp70 mRNA and causes the destruction of Hsp70 mRNA ().
('triptolide', 'induces', 'upregulation of microRNA')

These studies were done in pancreatic cancer, but it is likely that triptolide functions similarly in other cancers.
('studies', 'were done in', 'cancer')

In the same study, minnelide was also shown to induce miR-142-3p levels in mice bearing human pancreatic tumors while concurrently reducing Hsp70 mRNA.
('minnelide', 'was shown to induce', 'levels in mice bearing tumors')

It is probable that both triptolide and minnelide treatment of mesothelioma cells stimulated miR-142-3p, thus reducing aberrantly high Hsp70 levels and preventing cell growth as evident in the studies presented here.

In addition to miR-142-3p, there are many other potential targets of triptolide or minnelide.

Triptolide and minnelide resulted in robust cytotoxicity and induction of apoptosis in H2461 without substantial change in Hsp70 levels suggesting that Hsp70 does not play a major role in this cell line.
('Triptolide', 'resulted in', 'cytotoxicity')
('minnelide', 'resulted in', 'cytotoxicity')

DNA microarray investigations indicate that triptolide treatment upregulates 160 genes and downregulates 1511 genes in the non-small cell lung cancer cell line A549 ().
('triptolide treatment', 'upregulates', 'genes')
('triptolide treatment', 'downregulates', 'genes')

A recently identified target of triptolide is XPB (xeroderma pigmentosum type B), a subunit of transcription factor TFIIH (transcription factor II human).
('target of triptolide', 'is', 'XPB')

XPB becomes covalently bound when exposed to triptolide.
('XPB', 'becomes', 'bound')

This binding inhibits the DNAdependent ATPase activity of XPB and leads to inhibition of RNA polymerase II-mediated transcription.
('binding', 'inhibits', 'ATPase activity of XPB')
('binding', 'leads to', 'inhibition of RNA polymerase transcription')

Inhibition of XPB may explain much of the biological activities of triptolide that result in decreased expression of target genes ().
('Inhibition of XPB', 'may explain', 'much of activities of triptolide')

Other potential target genes for triptolide in a variety of cancers include caspase 3,8 and 9; XIAP; bcrabl; Bax; Bcl-2; p53; p21; NFÎºB; MRP-1; ERK-1/2; JNK-1/2; p38 MAPK; PI3K; 5-LOX; ADAM10; jak2; mcl-1; and histone methyltransferase ().
('target genes for triptolide', 'include', 'caspase 9 XIAP bcrabl Bax p53 p21 NFkB p38 MAPK PI3K ADAM10 jak2 histone methyltransferase')

This large number of cellular targets may also play a role in the antineoplastic efficacy of triptolide in some cell lines, such as H2461.
('number of targets', 'may play', 'role')

In conclusion, our data showing a significant reduction of tumor burden in mesothelioma xenografts support further clinical development of minnelide as a therapy for patients with mesothelioma.
('data showing reduction of tumor burden in mesothelioma xenografts', 'support', 'development of minnelide')

Furthermore, minnelide could be rationally combined with chemotherapy because Hsp70 is thought to be a chaperone of mediators of chemotherapy resistance ().
('minnelide', 'could be combined with', 'chemotherapy')

This approach is supported by our in vitro data suggesting that triptolide can be effectively combined with either gemcitabine or pemetrexed.
('approach', 'is supported by', 'data suggesting')
('triptolide', 'can be combined with', 'gemcitabine')

The active compound triptolide was employed in these in vitro studies, but the water-soluble prodrug minnelide would be utilized in in vivo investigations.
('compound triptolide', 'was employed in', 'these studies')
('prodrug minnelide', 'would be utilized in', 'investigations')

The standard of care for MM is combination therapy with cisplatin and pemetrexed.
('standard of care', 'is', 'combination therapy with cisplatin')

Our data support future testing of minnelide in combination with standard chemotherapy where it would be expected to deplete a cell of Hsp70, thus enhancing the activity of chemotherapeutic agents.
('data', 'support', 'testing of minnelide')

The data presented here support the use of minnelide in combination with commonly prescribed first- and second-line chemotherapy regimens for mesothelioma.
('data presented', 'support', 'use of minnelide')

Improvement in the chemotherapy response would be expected to favorably impact outcomes for these patients.
('Improvement in chemotherapy response', 'would be expected to impact', 'outcomes for patients')

The safety of combinatorial approaches would have to be empirically proven in appropriately designed phase I studies.
('safety of approaches', 'would have to be proven in', 'phase I studies')

Alternatively, our data also suggest that minnelide alone has substantial antitumor activity in mesothelioma.
('minnelide', 'has', 'antitumor activity in mesothelioma')

Minnelide is currently in a phase I clinical trial for patients with advanced gastrointestinal (GI) tumors (clinical trial identifier number: NCT01927965).

Once the maximum tolerated dose is determined and the established recommended dose of minnelide is obtained, a phase 2 study could be designed for treating patients with mesothelioma as a single agent.
('maximum', 'tolerated', 'dose')

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Cell lines and Cell culture

MM cell lines H513, H2373, H2461 and H2596 (American Tissue Culture Collection) were cultured in RPMI 1640 (Gibco, Invitrogen) containing 10% calf serum (Biofluids).

Enhanced cytotoxicity assays

For treatment conditions that included pemetrexed, cells from each cell line were seeded (1.5 Ã 105 per well) in six-well plates.

After overnight incubation, the medium was replaced with fresh medium or medium containing pemetrexed, triptolide, or pemetrexed plus triptolide at the indicated concentrations.
('medium', 'was replaced with', 'medium')

Vehicle concentration was identical for all wells.
('Vehicle concentration', 'was identical for', 'wells')

Seventy-two hours later, cells were washed twice with PBS, trypsinized, collected, and resuspended.

Cell number was then determined by counting viable cells after trypan blue treatment.
('Cell number', 'was determined by', 'counting cells')

Each experiment was done in triplicate.

Three thousand cells of each cell line were seeded as triplicate sets onto 96-well plates for cytotoxicity assessment with gemcitabine HCL (Eli Lilly).
('cells of cell line', 'were seeded as', 'triplicate sets onto plates')

After overnight incubation, cells were treated with the indicated concentrations of gemcitabine, triptolide, or both compounds.
('cells', 'were treated with', 'concentrations of gemcitabine')

Control cells were treated with identical concentrations of vehicle.
('Control cells', 'were treated with', 'concentrations of vehicle')

Cell viability was determined following seventy-two hour incubation using Cell Counting Kit-8 (Dojindo Molecular Technologies).
('Cell viability', 'was determined following', 'hour incubation using Cell Counting')

10 Î¼L of CCK-8 solution was added to each well and plates incubated for 2 hours at 370C.
('mL of solution', 'was added to', 'incubated for hours at 370C')

Absorbance was measured at 450 nm.
('Absorbance', 'was measured at', 'nm')

Cell survival was normalized to vehicle-treated cells.
