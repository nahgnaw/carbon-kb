INTRODUCTION

Mirk/dyrk1B is a gene upregulated and sometimes amplified in the majority of pancreatic cancers and in ovarian cancers [].

However, Mirk is a skeletal muscle kinase, so it was unclear what muscle function is maintained in these cancer cells.
('Mirk', 'is', 'muscle kinase')
('muscle function', 'is maintained in', 'cancer cells')

Mirk is not an essential gene because embryonic knockout of Mirk/dyrk1B caused no evident phenotype in mice [].
('Mirk', 'is', 'gene')
('knockout of Mirk/dyrk1B', 'caused', 'no phenotype in mice')

Skeletal muscle development appeared normal, so it is possible that other members of the dyrk family of related serine/threonine kinases were upregulated in the Mirk embryonic knockout mice.
('muscle development', 'appeared', 'normal')
('members of dyrk family of serine/threonine kinases', 'were upregulated in', 'Mirk knockout mice')

Mirk has greatest abundance and activity in normal diploid cells and in cancer cells transiently arrested in G0, or in early G1, with up to 10-fold lower levels in cycling cells [].
('Mirk', 'has', 'abundance activity in')

Mirk is sometimes considered a G0-kinase because, in poor growth conditions, Mirk mediates the arrest of cells in G0 by destabilizing the cyclin D family, preventing exit into G1, and by stabilizing the CDK inhibitor p27 needed for G0 arrest [],[].
('Mirk', 'mediates', 'arrest of cells')
('Mirk', 'preventing', 'exit into G1')

However, Mirk G0 function may not be significant in skeletal muscle development.
('Mirk G0 function', 'may not be significant in', 'muscle development')

Several investigators have shown that exit of undifferentiated myoblasts into G0 prevents differentiation, including myogenin induction [], and the increase in the myogenin transcription factors and chromatin binding factors, including MyoD, p68, p300 and p8, occurs in mid-G1 [], [].
('exit of myoblasts', 'prevents', 'differentiation')

Mirk/dyrk1B is a multifunctional serine/threonine kinase that plays critical roles in muscle differentiation by regulatory effects on cell cycle progression, transcription, and cell survival [], [].

The Mirk protein contains a bipartite nuclear localization sequence and during myogenesis, Mirk targets effector molecules in the nucleus to promote differentiation [], [].
('Mirk protein', 'contains', 'localization sequence')
('Mirk protein', 'targets', 'effector molecules in nucleus')
('Mirk', 'targets', 'effector molecules in nucleus')

Mirk promotes myoblast differentiation indirectly by phosphorylating class II histone deacetylases, causing them to accumulate in the cytoplasm and thus relieving suppression of myogenin-dependent transcription [].
('Mirk', 'promotes', 'myoblast differentiation')

Mirk acts to promote the survival of differentiating myoblasts, at least in part, by phosphorylating the CDK inhibitor p21, causing p21 to accumulate in the cytoplasm where it functions as an anti-apoptotic signaling molecule [].
('Mirk', 'acts to promote', 'survival of myoblasts')

However, p21 is often at low abundance in cancer cells, in particular when p53 is mutated or inactivated, so some other role of Mirk in normal muscle cell survival was sought.

RESULTS

The kinase Mirk/dyrk1B is found predominantly in the cytoplasm of differentiating C2C12 myoblasts and in adult skeletal muscle

The C2C12 in vitro model of myogenesis was used to characterize the functions of Mirk kinase in normal diploid cells[], [].
('model of myogenesis', 'was used to characterize', 'functions of Mirk kinase')

Mirk is expressed at very low levels in cycling cells and in most normal tissues except for skeletal muscle [].
('Mirk', 'is expressed at', 'levels')

Mirk is expressed at higher levels in differentiating C2C12 myotubes where it mediates survival [].
('Mirk', 'is expressed at', 'levels in differentiating C2C12 myotubes')

Mirk protein levels increased a mean of 13-fold when C2C12 myoblasts were placed in serum restricted differentiation medium (Fig.).
('Mirk protein levels', 'increased', 'mean')
('C2C12 myoblasts', 'were placed in', 'differentiation medium')

Endogenous Mirk was expressed at a low level in cycling C2C12 mouse myoblasts (Fig.), and was located diffusely throughout the cell, but primarily in the nucleus and perinuclear region (Fig. , top panels).
('Mirk', 'was expressed at', 'level in cycling C2C12 mouse myoblasts')

In sharp contrast to the pancellular distribution of Mirk in cycling myoblasts, a dramatic shift in the localization of Mirk to a solely cytoplasmic location was seen in differentiating G1-arrested myotubes within 2 days of shift to differentiation medium (Fig. , lower panels).
('shift in localization of Mirk', 'was seen in', 'differentiating myotubes')

Mirk localizes in the cytoplasm of differentiating C2C12 myoblasts and Mirk restriction to the cytoplasm persists in adult human skeletal muscle.
('Mirk', 'localizes in', 'cytoplasm of differentiating C2C12 myoblasts Mirk restriction')

(A) Mirk expression increases when myoblasts differentiate.

Mirk was detected by western blotting in C2C12 myoblasts in growth medium (day 0) or in differentiation medium for 3 days (days 1-3).(B) Mirk is cytoplasmic in differentiating myoblasts.
('Mirk', 'was detected by', 'western blotting in C2C12 myoblasts in growth medium')

Duplicate cultures of C2C12 myoblasts were cultured in differentiation medium for 1 day before partition into nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions and analysis of Mirk protein localization by western blotting.
('Duplicate', 'were cultured in', 'differentiation medium')

Fractionation was monitored by Western blotting for tubulin as the cytoplasmic (Cy) marker and MyoD as the nuclear (Nu) marker.
('Fractionation', 'was monitored by', 'Western blotting')

(C) Paraffin-embedded sections of adult human muscle were analyzed by immunohistochemistry with anti-Mirk C-terminal antibody.
('C sections of muscle', 'were analyzed by', 'immunohistochemistry with antibody')

Note that Mirk is found in only a subset of fibers, where it is localized exclusively in the cytoplasm and often enriched in the perinuclear region.
('Mirk', 'is found in', 'subset of fibers')

Mirk becomes restricted to the cytoplasm during myogenesis
('Mirk', 'becomes', 'restricted to cytoplasm')

Localization of endogenous Mirk in cultured C2C12 mouse myoblasts by immunofluorescence analysis using affinity-purified antibody to the Mirk C-terminus and anti-rabbit secondary antibody conjugated to Alexa Fluor 594.

Endogenous Mirk was detected in C2C12 myoblasts in growth medium (day 0) or in differentiation medium for 3 days (days 2-4).
('Mirk', 'was detected in', 'C2C12 myoblasts in growth medium')

Nuclei were visualized with DAPI.
('Nuclei', 'were visualized with', 'DAPI')

Original magnification 400X.

Scale bars = 50 Î¼m.

Subcellular fractionation of differentiating myoblasts confirmed that Mirk is primarily cytoplasmic in differentiating myoblasts, with an average of 6-fold more Mirk protein in the cytoplasmic fractions (Fig. ). Duplicate cultures of C2C12 myoblasts were cultured in differentiation medium for 1 day before partition into nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions and analysis for the presence of Mirk protein by western blotting.
('Mirk', 'is cytoplasmic in', 'myoblasts')

Later time points were not examined because the multinucleated myotubes proved very difficult to fractionate.
('myotubes', 'proved', 'difficult to fractionate')

The anti-C-terminal Mirk antibody used detects all of the splice variants of Mirk with known kinase activity [] in a variety of cell lines under both growth and differentiation conditions (data not shown).
('Mirk antibody used', 'detects', 'all of splice variants of Mirk')

Immune-complex kinase assays also had demonstrated that this antibody detects the active kinase in multiple cell types [].
('antibody', 'detects', 'kinase')

Traditional immunohistochemistry on formalin-fixed paraffin sections of adult human muscle was performed to determine the distribution of Mirk in mature myofibers.
('immunohistochemistry on paraffin sections of muscle', 'was performed to determine', 'distribution of Mirk')

Mirk was restricted to the cytoplasm of adult muscle fibers (Fig. ). No staining was noted in control sections treated with non-specific rabbit IgG instead of primary antibody (data not shown).
('Mirk', 'was restricted to', 'cytoplasm of muscle fibers')

Identical patterns of localization were observed using our two distinct anti-Mirk antibodies in immunofluorescence analysis of frozen sections of adult human muscle (data not shown), thus demonstrating that the findings did not occur due to a non-specific binding of either antibody.
('patterns of localization', 'were observed using demonstrating', 'antibodies')

Mirk/dyrk1B is found predominantly in the cytoplasm of fast-twitch fibers in adult skeletal muscle that produce reactive oxygen species during contraction

Fast twitch skeletal muscle endogenously produces ROS in response to repeated contractions [].
('twitch', 'produces', 'ROS')

Colocalization studies of Mirk with fast and slow myosin isoforms demonstrated that Mirk is expressed primarily in fast twitch fibers (Fig. ). Identical patterns of localization were observed using immunofluorescence analysis of frozen sections of adult human muscle (data not shown).

We have previously shown that Mirk plays a critical role in myoblast survival during differentiation [].
('Mirk', 'plays', 'role')

The localization of Mirk in the cytoplasm of adult fast-twitch muscle fibers suggests that Mirk continues to play a role in adult muscle cell survival, perhaps by modulating the response to metabolic stress due to ROS produced during muscle contractions.
('Mirk', 'continues to play', 'role')

Mirk is expressed predominantly in fast-twitch fibers in adult human muscle

Paraffin-embedded sections of adult human skeletal muscle were simultaneously incubated with rabbit polyclonal antibody against the unique Mirk C-terminus and a monoclonal mouse antibody against either the slow-twitch or the fast-twitch specific isoforms of myosin.
('sections of muscle', 'were incubated with', 'rabbit antibody')

Mirk labeling was subsequently visualized with an Alexa Fluor 488 conjugate (green), while the myosin isoforms were visualized with Alexa Fluor 594 (red).
('Mirk labeling', 'was visualized with', 'Alexa Fluor conjugate')
('myosin isoforms', 'were visualized with', 'Alexa')

Original magnification 200X.

Mirk kinase inhibitor acts like Mirk depletion
('Mirk kinase inhibitor', 'acts like', 'Mirk depletion')

Mirk is an active kinase in C2C12 cells, as shown by the ability of immunopreciptated Mirk to phosphorylate myelin basic protein (Fig.4A).
('Mirk', 'is', 'kinase in C2C12 cells')

Mirk maintains the survival of cycling myoblasts during the initial steps of differentiation as shown by Mirk depletion by RNAi [].
('Mirk', 'maintains', 'survival of cycling myoblasts')

Similarly to Mirk depletion, Mirk kinase inhibitors should reduce the viability of differentiating myoblasts.
('Mirk kinase inhibitors', 'should reduce', 'viability of myoblasts')

This was observed as each of four Mirk kinase inhibitors reduced the numbers of differentiating myoblasts (Fig ).

Visual inspection revealed that single myoblasts were less in evidence in the cultures treated with the higher concentrations of Mirk kinase inhibitors, although large, fused differentiated post-mitotic myotubules remained in evidence (Fig.).
('myotubules', 'remained in', 'evidence')

Analysis of the muscle regulatory transcription factor myogenin, which mediates myoblast differentiation into myotubules, and the late maturation marker, fast twitch troponin T, showed that Mirk kinase inhibition with 3 different Mirk inhibitors during differentiation led to an increase in each differentiation marker compared to the differentiated myoblast culture (Fig., right), consistent with the enrichment of differentiated myotubules because of loss of the undifferentiated cycling myoblasts.
('Mirk kinase inhibition with Mirk inhibitors', 'led to', 'increase in differentiation marker')

The increase in myogenin levels in the Mirk kinase inhibitor treated cultures was more marked after 1 day of differentiation, while the increase in the later induced troponin T levels was seen after 4 days.
('increase in myogenin levels', 'was marked after', 'day of differentiation')
('increase in troponin T levels', 'was seen after', 'days')

Thus the Mirk kinase inhibitors induced phenotype similar to Mirk depletion.
('Mirk kinase inhibitors', 'induced', 'phenotype')

Since Mirk kinase mediates myoblast survival during differentiation, a Mirk kinase inhibitor should kill differentiating C2C12 myoblasts.
('Mirk kinase', 'mediates', 'myoblast survival')
('Mirk kinase inhibitor', 'should kill differentiating', 'C2C12 myoblasts')

(A) Mirk was immunoprecipitated from C2C12 myoblasts overnight with either an N'terminal directed affinity-purified polyclonal antibody to Mirk or with rabbit purified IgG as control.
('A Mirk', 'was immunoprecipitated from', 'C2C12 myoblasts')

The kinase activity of immunoprecipitated Mirk, after collection on protein-A agarose beads was determined by an immune complex kinase reaction on myelin basic protein (MBP), which was analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by autoradiography.(B) C2C12 myoblasts were cultured in differentiation medium for 3 days with increasing concentrations of the Mirk kinase inhibitors EHT5372, EHT6840, EHT1610, or 11-411.
('kinase activity of Mirk', 'was determined by', 'complex kinase reaction on protein')

('C2C12 cells', 'were placed in', 'differentiation medium')
('C2C12 cells', 'treated with', 'Mirk inhibitors')

(right) Parallel cultures to panel B after 1 and 4 days of culture in differentiation medium were analyzed by western blotting for the transcription factor myogenin which controls myogenesis, the late maturation marker, fast twitch troponin T and a nonspecific band in the troponin blot as a western blotting control.

Enrichment in differentiated, fused myoblasts should increase the level of differentiation markers.
('Enrichment in differentiated', 'should increase', 'level of differentiation markers')

Inhibition of Mirk kinase activity or Mirk depletion in C2C12 myoblasts leads to increased ROS levels
('Inhibition of Mirk kinase activity', 'leads to', 'ROS levels')

Treatment with increasing concentrations of the Mirk kinase inhibitor EHT 5372 led to a dose-dependent increase in ROS values in differentiating myoblasts after 2 or 3 days (Fig.).
('Treatment with concentrations of Mirk kinase inhibitor EHT', 'led to', 'increase in ROS values')

Differentiating C2C12 myoblasts were transiently transfected with pSilencer plasmids expressing either Si1 to a sequence in murine Mirk cDNA within exon 3, Si3 to a sequence in exon 10, or a mutant sequence [].
('Differentiating', 'were transfected with', 'pSilencer plasmids expressing Si1 Si3 to sequence in exon')

Depletion of Mirk by Si1 or Si3 led to an average 5.6 fold decrease in Mirk protein levels and to a 60% increase in ROS levels (Fig.).
('Depletion of Mirk', 'led to', 'decrease in Mirk protein levels')

Thus both Mirk depletion and Mirk kinase inactivation led to an increase in ROS generation in differentiating myotubules, a model for skeletal muscle.
('Mirk depletion', 'led to', 'increase in ROS generation')
('Mirk kinase inactivation', 'led to', 'increase in ROS generation')

ROS levels increased after Mirk depletion or Mirk kinase inhibition in differentiating C2C12 myoblasts, a model for muscle fibers.
('ROS levels', 'increased after', 'Mirk depletion')

(A) C2C12 myoblasts were cultured in differentiation medium for 2 or 3 days with increasing concentrations of the Mirk kinase inhibitor EHT5372.
('A C2C12 myoblasts', 'were cultured in', 'differentiation medium for days')

Four parallel cultures were assayed for each data point, with only two cultures receiving the CH-H2DCFA ROS indicator dye (5Î¼M), and the others serving as controls.
('cultures', 'were assayed for', 'data point')

ROS values subtracted for control cultures not treated with Mirk kinase inhibitors.

Mean of two separate experiments +/âSD.

(B) C2C12 myoblasts were differentiation medium for 1 day, then transfected for 1 day with either pSilencer plasmid pSiM1 (directed to exon 3 of the murine Mirk/dyrkB gene) or pSiM3 (directed to exon 10) or pSiM2 as the negative control (directed to exon 3 but mutant at 2 positions).
('B C2C12 myoblasts', 'were', 'differentiation medium for day transfected for day')

Four parallel cultures were assayed for each data point as in panel A.
('cultures', 'were assayed for', 'data point')

(lower panel) Parallel cultures analyzed for Mirk protein levels, with area of the blot then stained with Coomassie brilliant blue to show loading of the gel.(C) Mirk was depleted in the stable Mirk transfectant of the HD3 colon cancer lines, T10, and the vector control transfectant with synthetic RNAi duplexes siA (M lanes) or a GC-matched control, then examined for Mirk and actin levels by western blotting.

(right panel) After Mirk depletion, ROS levels were measured as in panel A.
('ROS levels', 'were measured as', 'in')

One set of HD3/vector transfectant cells were treated with 100Î¼M hydrogen peroxide for 4 hours as a positive control.
('set of HD3/vector cells', 'were treated with', '100mM hydrogen peroxide')

Mean +/â SD shown, n=3.(D) C2C12 myoblasts were plated at high density and cultured until they were confluent and fused to form differentiated myotubes capable of contraction like skeletal muscle fibers.

Cultures were then treated for 24 hr with increasing concentrations of the Mirk kinase inhibitor EHT 5372.
('Cultures', 'were treated for', 'hr')

Four parallel cultures were assayed for each data point as in panel A.
('cultures', 'were assayed for', 'data point')

Mean +/âSD shown.

However, Mirk kinase inactivation was much more effective than Mirk depletion in inducing ROS.
('Mirk kinase inactivation', 'was effective than', 'Mirk depletion in inducing ROS')

Possibly the Mirk kinase inhibitors affect other kinases which modify ROS levels.
('Mirk kinase inhibitors', 'affect', 'kinases')

Alternatively, Mirk is a rather stable protein which dimerizes in vivo and is found in large molecular weight complexes over 660 kDa [] where it maintains the integrity of the DREAM complex consisting of p130/Rb2, cyclin D, CDK4, CDK inhibitors, and other proteins [].
('Mirk', 'is', 'protein')
('Mirk', 'is found in', 'weight complexes over kDa')

In addition, Mirk phosphorylates class II histone deacetylases, causing them to accumulate in the cytoplasm and thus relieving suppression of myogenin-dependent transcription [].
('Mirk', 'phosphorylates', 'class histone deacetylases')
('Mirk', 'causing to accumulate', 'them')
('Mirk', 'relieving', 'suppression of transcription')

Mirk may half a long half-life in these complexes, while Mirk depletion may reduce the amount of any non-complexed Mirk molecules.
('Mirk depletion', 'may reduce', 'amount of Mirk molecules')

Since Mirk is a kinase and is at high abundance in myoblasts, as much as in Panc1 cells where the Mirk gene is amplified, Mirk depletion may not remove enough Mirk to see an effect, while a small molecule inhibitor could diffuse throughout the cell to reach many Mirk molecules.
('Mirk', 'is', 'kinase')
('Mirk', 'is at', 'abundance in myoblasts')
('Mirk', 'may not remove to see', 'Mirk')
('Mirk depletion', 'may not remove to see', 'Mirk')
('molecule inhibitor', 'could diffuse throughout', 'cell')

To test this hypothesis, the effect of knockdown of Mirk by synthetic duplex RNAi was tested in two stably transfected clones of the HD3 colon carcinoma cell line, the vector control transfectant and stable Mirk T10 transfectant expressing more Mirk protein [].
('effect of knockdown of Mirk', 'was tested in', 'clones of HD3 colon carcinoma cell line')

After Mirk knockdown, the vector transfectant had only 10% of the original level of Mirk, while Mirk levels in the stable transfectant were only reduced 30% (Fig.).
('vector transfectant', 'had', '% of level of Mirk')
('Mirk levels in transfectant', 'were reduced', '%')

The 10-fold knockdown of Mirk in the vector control line led to a 2-fold increase in ROS levels (Fig.), similar to the increase in ROS levels seen after introduction of a K-ras mutation [].
('knockdown of Mirk', 'led to', 'increase in ROS levels')

The 30% knockdown of Mirk in the Mirk stable transfectant line still left 20 times as much Mirk as in the vector control transfectant, and no increase in ROS was seen.
('knockdown of Mirk', 'left', 'Mirk')

As a positive control, the vector control line was treated with 100 Î¼M hydrogen peroxide for 4 hours resulting in a 2-fold increase in ROS levels.
('vector control line', 'was treated with', 'mM hydrogen peroxide')

These levels were increased slightly by Mirk knockdown.

Thus colon cancer cells depleted of Mirk exhibited a 2-fold increase in ROS levels, similar to the increase seen when two pancreatic cancer cell lines were depleted of Mirk by either RNAi duplexes or an inducible shRNA to Mirk [].
('colon cancer cells depleted of Mirk', 'exhibited', 'increase in ROS levels')
('cancer cell lines', 'were depleted of', 'Mirk')

The experiments thus far have shown that either Mirk kinase inhibition or Mirk depletion reduce the viability of differentiating myoblasts by increasing the intracellular levels of toxic ROS.
('Mirk kinase inhibition', 'reduce', 'viability of differentiating myoblasts')
('Mirk depletion', 'reduce', 'viability of differentiating myoblasts')

However, Mirk protein is localized in fast twitch fibers of postmitotic, polynuclear mature skeletal muscle.
('Mirk protein', 'is localized in', 'fast')

C2C12 myoblasts at high density in differentiation media will fuse to form differentiated postmitotic myotubes that can contract.

A Mirk kinase inhibitor induced a dose-dependent increase in ROS in such postmitotic cultures (Fig.) without evident loss of cells.
('Mirk kinase inhibitor', 'induced', 'increase in ROS')

Thus Mirk acts to reduce ROS in this model of fast twitch skeletal muscle fibers.
('Mirk', 'acts to reduce', 'ROS')

Depletion of Mirk by an inducible shRNA in SU86.86 pancreatic cancer cells shows loss of antioxidant combating activity
('Depletion of Mirk', 'shows', 'loss of activity')

To identify antioxidant genes which were downregulated when Mirk levels were depleted, we utilized SU86.86 pancreatic cancer cells stably expressing a doxycycline-inducible shRNA to Mirk, in which ROS levels previously had been shown to increase when Mirk was depleted about 8 to 10-fold [].
('Mirk', 'was depleted about', '8')

Eight genes with known antioxidant properties were downregulated when Mirk was depleted for 4 days in these cells, as measured by quantitative RT-PCR assaying a series of antioxidant genes (Table ).
('Mirk', 'was depleted for', 'days')

Hydrogen peroxide is a strong oxidant within cells.
('Hydrogen peroxide', 'is', 'oxidant within cells')

Three peroxidases are upregulated by Mirk, glutathione peroxidase (GPX2) a major hydrogen peroxide reducer in the GI tract, peroxidasin (PXDNL), and peroxiredoxin 2 (PRDX2).
('peroxidases', 'are upregulated by', 'Mirk')

The latter reduces hydrogen peroxide and alkyl hydroperoxides while another Mirk-regulated gene sulfiredoxin (SRXN1) reactivates hyperoxidized peroxiredoxin through reduction of cysteine sulfinic acid in the active site.
('gene sulfiredoxin', 'reactivates', 'peroxiredoxin')

Lipoxygenases and cyclooxygenases are key mediators of aracidonic acid metabolism, and one of each, 12-LOX and COX2, are upregulated by Mirk.
('Lipoxygenases', 'are', 'mediators of acid metabolism')
('cyclooxygenases', 'are', 'mediators of acid metabolism')

Thus Mirk kinase was found expressed in mature fast twitch skeletal muscle, where it could reduce ROS levels arising from contraction by upregulating the expression of a series of antioxidant genes.

DISCUSSION

The Mirk kinase gene has been localized to the 19q13 amplicon [] is amplified in a subset of pancreatic cancers and ovarian cancers, and less frequently in colon cancers, and is upregulated in the majority of these cancers [], [].
('Mirk kinase gene', 'has been localized to', '19q13 amplicon')

Mirk is expressed at very low levels in most normal diploid cells except for skeletal muscle.
('Mirk', 'is expressed at', 'levels')

The muscle cell function of Mirk kinase selected for by cancer cells was unknown, although Mirk knockdown reduced myoblast viability by 75% [].
('Mirk knockdown', 'reduced', 'myoblast viability')

In the current study we show that Mirk kinase depletion and Mirk kinase inhibition increase the amount of toxic ROS induced in differentiating C2C12 myoblasts and in postmitotic cultures of fused, contractile myotubes that model skeletal muscle.
('Mirk kinase depletion', 'increase', 'amount of ROS induced in differentiating C2C12 myoblasts')
('Mirk kinase inhibition', 'increase', 'amount of ROS induced in differentiating C2C12 myoblasts')

The results of this study showed that Mirk is localized in fast twitch skeletal muscles.
('Mirk', 'is localized in', 'fast')

Such muscle endogenously produces ROS in response to repeated contractions.
('muscle', 'produces', 'ROS')

Thus Mirk combats the ROS generated by contraction in skeletal muscle, so some cancer cells upregulate Mirk or amplify the Mirk gene to combat ROS.
('Mirk', 'combats', 'ROS generated by contraction in muscle')
('cancer cells', 'upregulate', 'Mirk')
('cancer cells', 'amplify to combat', 'Mirk gene')

ROS are oxygen containing chemical species with reactive chemical properties, such as hydroxyl radicals, which contain an unpaired electron and the free radical superoxide.
('ROS', 'are', 'oxygen containing chemical species')

Hydrogen peroxide is produced in contracting muscle, breaking down to ROS species, which can have diverse effects on myoblasts, such as inducing mitochondrial fragmentation [].
('Hydrogen peroxide', 'is produced in', 'contracting muscle')

Many investigators have reported that ROS levels increase during myoblast differentiation.
('ROS levels', 'increase during', 'myoblast differentiation')

Mitochondria also are a source of ROS in skeletal muscle cells [], [].
('Mitochondria', 'are', 'source of ROS')

ROS generation within single intact muscle fibers was cytosolic, with a role for NADPH oxidase-derived ROS during contractile activity [].

Cancer cells often exhibit higher levels of ROS than normal cells because of increased metabolism and oncogenic stimulation, so are under increased oxidative stress.
('Cancer cells', 'exhibit', 'levels of ROS')

Genes which detoxify superoxide (superoxide dismutases 2 and 3) and which prevent the generation of hydroxyl radical (ferroxidase/ceruloplasmin) were found to be upregulated in SU86.86 pancreatic cancer cells in prior work [] and in this study (Table ), and in each of four ovarian cancer cell lines [] through Mirk.

These genes work together to reduce ROS.
('genes', 'work to reduce', 'ROS')

Superoxide dismutases detoxify superoxide resulting in hydrogen peroxide, which in turn can either be metabolized to water or to hydroxyl radical through the Fenton reaction if Fe++ is available.
('Superoxide dismutases', 'detoxify', 'superoxide resulting in hydrogen peroxide')

Conversion to hydroxyl radical is blocked by ferroxidase that converts Fe++ to Fe+++.
('Conversion to hydroxyl radical', 'is blocked by', 'ferroxidase')

Mirk is a co-activator for several transcription factors and increases the expression of these antioxidant genes and 6 others in pancreatic cancer cells [], Table . Recently peroxiredoxin-2 upregulated by NFkappaB was shown to attenuate oxidative stress during the differentiation of C2C12 cells [].

Interestingly, peroxiredoxin-2 expression was decreased when Mirk was depleted (Table ), suggesting the Mirk may play a role in control of expression of this antioxidant gene during myogenesis.
('Mirk', 'may play', 'role')

Depletion of Mirk in C2C12 cells, followed by sorting of the transfected cells, showed that pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4 (PDK4) mRNA was upregulated 6 fold when Mirk was depleted [].
('kinase mRNA', 'was upregulated', 'fold')

PDK4 inhibits one component of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex that transforms pyruvate into acetyl-CoA.

This function of the PD complex results in the generation of NADH, which reduces ROS, so increasing PDK4 levels will inhibit NADH generation and lead to increased ROS levels.
('function of PD complex', 'results in', 'generation of NADH increasing PDK4 levels')

Mirk kinase inhibition also led to increased Pdk4 protein (data not shown).
('Mirk kinase inhibition', 'led to', 'Pdk4 protein')

Thus these Mirk-upregulated genes working together increase antioxidant potential while minimizing hydroxyl production.
('genes working', 'increase', 'potential')
