INTRODUCTION

Cancer cells undergo increased aerobic glycolysis, increasingly relying on this metabolic pathway to generate ATP to sustain elevated proliferation.

That an impaired glucose metabolism leads to lactic acid secretion in the presence of oxygen was first described by Warburg in the 1920s [].
('glucose metabolism', 'leads to', 'acid secretion')
('leads to acid secretion', 'was described by', 'Warburg')

This increased aerobic glycolysis has since been observed in many tumor cells.

Consequently, specific drugs designed to interfere with energy-producing pathways of many cancer types have been investigated [,], such as the glycolytic inhibitors 2-deoxyglucose [], and 3-BrPA [].

3-BrPA is an analogue of pyruvate with high tumor selectivity [,].

In mammals, there are four hexokinase isoforms, HK1, HK2, HK3, and HK4, encoded by separate genes.

HK2 is expressed at relatively high level only in skeletal muscles, adipose tissues, and heart.

Despite its absence or low expression in the majority of adult normal cells, HK2 is widely over-expressed in many cancer cells [].

Patra's group showed that HK2 expression is dramatically elevated in tumors derived from mouse models of lung and breast cancer [].
('HK2 expression', 'is elevated in', 'tumors derived from mouse models of lung')

Cecilia's group found that HK I and II inhibition by metformin could modify glucose metabolism in triple-negative breast cancer both in cultured cells and xenograft models [].
('HK inhibition by metformin', 'could modify', 'glucose metabolism in breast cancer')

So it seemed feasible that HK2 could be a selective therapeutic target for cancer.

3-BrPA can not only inhibit HKII and prevent glucose from entering the glycolytic pathway [], but the compound can also induce cell death by activating the mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis or necrosis [,].
('compound', 'can induce', 'cell death')

Programmed cell death is executed through specific intracellular biochemical pathways.
('cell death', 'is executed through', 'pathways')

Apoptosis, autophagy, necrosis and/or necroptosis are three common forms of programmed cell death distinguished according to their morphological, enzymological and functional criteria.
('Apoptosis', 'are', 'forms of cell death distinguished according to')

Apoptosis is executed by a group of intracellular cysteine proteases, namely caspases.
('Apoptosis', 'is executed by', 'group of cysteine proteases')

Necrosis, on the other hand, is associated with organelle swelling, cytoplasmic membrane breakdown, and ensuing inflammation responses [].
('Necrosis', 'is associated with', 'swelling')

Necroptosis is a regulated necrotic cell death triggered by broad caspase inhibition and is characterized by necrotic cell death morphology and the activation of autophagy [].
('Necroptosis', 'is', 'cell death triggered by caspase inhibition')
('Necroptosis', 'is characterized by', 'cell death morphology')

Receptor-interacting protein kinase 1 (RIP1) kinase activity is then crucial for this pathway, which may also be mediated via the Fas, TNF or TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) death receptors [].
('kinase kinase activity', 'is crucial for', 'pathway')

Autophagy is a major intracellular pathway for the degradation and recycling of unused but long-lived proteins, damaged organelles, and even invasive pathogens [,].
('Autophagy', 'is', 'pathway for degradation')

Some studies have highlighted the importance of autophagy in several organs, including the brain, heart, hematopoietic cells, and the kidney [,,,].
('studies', 'have highlighted', 'importance of autophagy')

For instance, systemic autophagy-knockout mice die within one day after birth [].
('mice', 'die within', 'day')

Although autophagy is important for normal cell function and survival, it is also used by tumor cells and may be therapeutically counterproductive [,].
('autophagy', 'is important for', 'cell function')

Activation of autophagy has been suggested to promote cell survival [], so a combination chemotherapeutic treatment with an autophagy inhibitor could promote tumor cell death [].
('combination treatment with inhibitor', 'could promote', 'tumor cell death')
('Activation of autophagy', 'has been suggested to promote', 'cell survival')

Chloroquine (CQ) is an anti-malarial drug, as well as a well-known lysosomotropic agent that inhibits late-stage autophagy [].
('Chloroquine', 'is', 'drug')

An analogue of CQ, hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), has also been shown to have antitumor properties [].
('analogue of CQ', 'has been shown to have', 'antitumor properties')

HCQ promotes tumor cell death though either p53 activation or alkylation in a mouse model of c-Myc-driven lymphoma [].
('HCQ', 'promotes', 'tumor cell death')

However, the precise mechanism by which autophagy inhibition promotes cancer cell death remains to be determined, particularly with respect to glycolytic inhibitors and the definition of cancer susceptibility to autophagy inhibition.
('autophagy inhibition', 'promotes', 'cancer cell death')

The role of autophagy in 3-BrPA-induced cell death in human breast cancer cells has not, to our knowledge, been explored.

Thus, we investigated whether autophagic machinery could be activated in breast cancer cells after 3-BrPA treatment and whether inhibition of autophagy enhanced 3-BrPA-mediated cell death.
('inhibition of autophagy', 'enhanced', 'cell death')
('machinery', 'could be activated in', 'breast cancer cells')
('machinery', 'enhanced', 'cell death')

Furthermore, we demonstrated that ROS formation increased cell sensitivity to death via autophagy inhibition.
('ROS formation', 'increased', 'cell sensitivity to death')

Finally, we demonstrated that inhibition of autophagy enhanced 3-BrPA-mediated cell death in vivo.
('inhibition of autophagy', 'enhanced', 'cell death')

RESULTS

The effects of 3-BrPA on cell proliferation in breast cancer cell lines MDA-MB-435 and MDA-MB-231

As an analogue of pyruvate, 3-BrPA can induce cell death in certain tumor cell lines.

To investigate 3-BrPA's potential to inhibit cell growth in breast cancer cells (MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-435), cell viability was measured with an MTT assay after incubation of each cell line with 3-BrPA for various periods.
('cell viability', 'was measured with', 'MTT assay after incubation of cell line')

As shown in Figure , 3-BrPA (0–320 μM) reduced MDA-MB-231 cell growth in a dose- and time- dependent manner.

3-BrPA had little effect on MDA-MB-435 cell growth (Figure ).

As visualized with an inverted microscope, viable MDA-MB-231 cells decreased significantly and dose-dependent manner after 24 h of 3-BrPA treatment.

Most cells shrank and became rounded before detaching from the culture plates (Figure ), whereas viable MDA-MB-435 cells only modestly decreased.
('cells', 'shrank', 'cells decreased')
('cells', 'became', 'rounded before detaching from culture plates')

These data prompted us to explore the unique effects of 3-BrPA on MDA-MB-435 and MDA-MB-231 cells.
('data', 'prompted to explore', 'us')

3-BrPA affects the cell viability of breast cancer cells

(A) Cells seeded on 96-well plates (5×103 cells/well) were treated with the indicated concentrations of 3-BrPA for 24, 48, and 72 h.
('A Cells seeded on plates', 'were treated with', 'concentrations')

Then, relative cell viability was assessed using an MTT assay.
('cell viability', 'was assessed using', 'MTT assay')

(B) After incubation with the indicated concentrations of 3-BrPA, cells were photographed using an inverted microscope.
('cells', 'were photographed using', 'microscope')

3-BrPA induces autophagy in breast cancer cells

First electron microscopy (EM) was used to visualize cell morphology after both cell lines were treated with 3-BrPA.
('First electron microscopy', 'was used to visualize', 'cell morphology')

As shown in Figure , 3-BrPA treatment increased the presence of autophagosomes filled with debris in both cell lines; only a few vacuoles were observed in control cells.
('vacuoles', 'were observed in', 'control cells')

Autophagy-specific markers such as microtubule-associated protein 1 LC3, Beclin-1 were used to quantify autophagy with immunoblot analysis.

As shown in Figure , conversion of LC3 I/II and up-regulation of Beclin-1 suggested increased formation of autophagosomes in a time-dependent manner in breast cancer cells.
('conversion of LC3 I/II', 'suggested', 'formation of autophagosomes')

Induction of autophagy by 3-BrPA was then examined by imaging the cellular distribution of GFP-LC3, a fusion construct of green fluorescent protein with LC3.
('Induction of autophagy', 'was examined by', 'imaging')

In control cells, GFP-LC3 puncta were mainly distributed to the cytosol, indicating a low level of autophagy under these conditions (Figure , left panel).
('puncta', 'were distributed to', 'cytosol')

In contrast, cells incubated with 3-BrPA for 12 h revealed many autophagosomes with accumulated GFP-LC3 (presumably as GFP-LC3-II).
('cells incubated', 'revealed', 'autophagosomes')

Quantification data for puncta per cell are depicted in Figure . These data suggest that 3-BrPA induces a complete autophagic response in breast cancer cells.
('Quantification data for puncta per cell', 'are depicted in', 'Figure')

3-BrPA induces autophagy in breast cancer cells

(A) Breast cancer cells MDA-MB-435 and MDA-MB-231 were treated with 320μM 3-BrPA and 160 μM 3-BrPA respectively for 12 h as indicated.

Then cells were collected and prepared for electron microscopy (EM) analysis as described in materials and methods.
('cells', 'prepared for', 'microscopy analysis')

The arrows indicate the appearance of autophagosomes (scale bar = 200 nm).
('arrows', 'indicate', 'appearance of autophagosomes')

(B) Cells were treated as above for 0, 1, 2, 4, 8, and 12 h as indicated, and the extracted protein was immunoblotted against LC3 and Beclin-1 antibody.
('B Cells', 'were treated as', 'above')

β-actin was used to normalize the data for equal protein loading.

(C) Cells were transiently transfected with GFP-tagged LC3 plasmid DNA (GFP-LC3), treated with 3-BrPA (320 μM) and 3-BrPA (160 μM) as above for 12 h, then subjected to confocal microscopy analysis (scale bar = 10μm).

Autophagy inhibition enhances 3-BrPA-induced cell death
('Autophagy inhibition', 'enhances', 'cell death')

To investigate the role of autophagy in cell death, we inhibited autophagy with CQ or 3-Methyladenine (3-MA) and measured cell death.

As expected, a significant increase in 3-BrPA-induced cell death was observed in breast cancer cells after autophagy was inhibited with CQ or 3-MA (Figure ).
('increase in cell death', 'was observed in', 'breast cancer cells')
('autophagy', 'was inhibited with', 'CQ')

As viewed with an inverted microscope, viable MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-435 cells were significantly decreased after 3-BrPA plus CQ treatment for 12 h.

The majority of cells shrank and became round before detaching from the culture plates (Figure ).
('majority of cells', 'became round before', 'detaching from culture plates')

Moreover, annexin V-propidium iodide staining revealed a significant increase in cell death (defined as annexin V+ and PI V+cells) after 3-BrPA plus CQ treatment (Figure ).
('annexin iodide staining', 'revealed', 'increase in cell death defined as annexin V')

Autophagy inhibition enhances 3-BrPA-induced cell death in vitro
('Autophagy inhibition', 'enhances', 'cell death')

(A) After pre-incubation with 40 μM CQ/5 mM 3-MA for 1 h, MDA-MB-435 cells and MDA-MB-231 cells were treated with 320 μM 3-BrPA and 160 μM 3-BrPA respectively for 12 h, and the relative cell viability was assessed with an MTT assay.

('B Cells', 'were treated as', 'above')

Then cells were photographed using an inverted microscope.
('cells', 'were photographed using', 'microscope')

(C) After pre-incubation with 40 μM CQ for 1 h, cells were treated as above, then stained with Annexin V-FITC/PI and measured using flow cytometry.
('cells', 'were treated as', 'above')

(D)After cells were treated as above, and cell lysates were prepared, then subjected to western blot analysis to measure LC3 and Beclin-1.
('D', 'were treated as', 'above')

Lysates were also assayed to measure Bak, Bax, Bcl-2 and Mcl-1.
('Lysates', 'were assayed to measure', 'Bak Bax')

β-actin was used to normalize the data for equal protein loading.

Data represent 2 independent experiments.
('Data', 'represent', 'experiments')

(E) Cell lysates were collected 48 h posttransfection and knockdown efficiency of Atg7 RNAi was assessed using western blot quantification of Atg7 and β-actin.
('E Cell lysates', 'were collected', 'h posttransfection efficiency')

(F) Cells were transfected with the control or Atg7 siRNAs.
('F Cells', 'were transfected with', 'control')

Then, after 48 h posttransfection, MDA-MB-435 cells and MDA-MB-231 cells were treated with 320 μM and 160 μM 3-BrPA respectively, and/or with 40 μM CQ for 12 h, and relative cell viability was assessed with an MTT assay.

*, p&lt;0.05 versus control at a given time point.

To ascertain whether 3-BrPA plus CQ affects autophagy, we measured expression of autophagy-related proteins using western blot.

Accumulation of LC3-II indicates high flux through the autophagy pathway, 3-BrPA increased turnover and clearance of LC3-positive autophagosomes and LC3-II as indicated by western blot and increased autophagic flux blocked was with CQ.
('Accumulation', 'indicates', 'flux through autophagy pathway')
('flux', 'blocked', 'was with CQ')

Accordingly, the concentration of Beclin1 was reduced by 3-BrPA in the presence of CQ (Figure ).

Examining apoptosis-related proteins, we discovered that 3-BrPA plus CQ treatment significantly inhibited anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 and MCl-1 expression and enhanced pro-apoptotic Bax and Bak expression (Figure ).

Knockdown of Atg7 siRNA also sensitized breast cancer cells to 3-BrPA, indicating that autophagy was responsible for 3-BrPA resistance (Figure ).
('Knockdown of Atg7 siRNA', 'sensitized', 'breast cancer cells')
('autophagy', 'was responsible for', 'resistance')

These data suggest that autophagy is a mechanism of resistance to 3-BrPA that could be reversed by genetic blockade of autophagy initiation or pharmacologic blockade of cargo degradation.
('autophagy', 'is', 'mechanism of resistance')

3-BrPA plus CQ treatment induces RIPK1-dependent apoptosis in MDA-MB-435 cells and RIPK1/3-dependent necroptosis in MDA-MB-231 cells

To confirm the cell death type induced by the combination of 3-BrPA and CQ, we used a broad spectrum caspase inhibitor, z-VAD-fmk to rescue cells from death induced by 3-BrPA plus CQ treatment.

As shown in Figures , an MTT assay revealed that z-VAD-fmk rescued MDA-MB-435 cells, but exacerbated cell death in MDA-MB-231 cells.

Using EM, we observed that 3-BrPA plus CQ-treated MDA-MB-231 cells had ruptured plasma membranes, indicating necrosis (Figure ).

Death may also occur by a programmed form of necrosis, necroptosis, which requires RIPK1 and RIPK3 activation by death receptors [] or other death receptor-independent mechanisms [].
('Death', 'may occur by', 'form of necrosis')

To assess whether 3-BrPA plus CQ treatment induced necroptosis, MDA-MB-231 cells were treated with 3-BrPA plus CQ with/without the specific RIPK1 and necroptosis inhibitor necrostatin-1 (Nec-1).
('necroptosis', 'were treated', 'RIPK1')

Nec-1 alone had no effect on cells, but dramatically restored cell survival by after treatment with 3-BrPA plus CQ in MDA-MB-231 cells, and it also had the same effect on MDA-MB-435 cells (Figures ).

Knockdown of RIPK1 in both cell lines (Figure ) also suppressed cell death and enhanced cell viability (Figure ).
('Knockdown of RIPK1', 'suppressed', 'cell death')
('Knockdown of RIPK1', 'enhanced', 'cell viability')

Similarly, MDA-MB-231 cells treated with a validated siRNA against RIPK3 (Figure ) were significantly more viable after treatment with 3-BrPA plus CQ, while knockdown of RIPK3 had no effect on MDA-MB-435 cells (Figure ).
('cells treated with siRNA against RIPK3', 'were viable after', 'treatment')
('knockdown of RIPK3', 'had', 'no effect')

These data suggest that 3-BrPA and CQ induce two different cell death types in MDA-MB-435 cells and MDA-MB-231 cells, and both death pathways require RIPK1.
('death pathways', 'require', 'RIPK1')

3-BrPA and CQ co-operate to induce RIPK1-dependent apoptosis in MDA-MB-435 cells, but induce RIPK1/3-dependent necroptosis in MDA-MB-231 cells

(A) After pre-incubation with 10 μM z-VAD-fmk for 1 h, cells were treated with 160 μM 3-BrPA and/or with 20 μM CQ for 24 h.

Then, relative cell viability was assessed with an MTT assay.
('cell viability', 'was assessed with', 'MTT assay')

ROS production causes cell death with 3-BrPA and autophagy inhibition
('ROS production', 'causes', 'cell death with inhibition')

Next, to elucidate the mechanism which leads to the initiation of 3-BrPA-related autophagy, we quantified intracellular ROS in breast cancer cells after a 12 h incubation with 3-BrPA, CQ, or a combination of both drugs.

As shown in Figure , ROS generation was markedly increased in cells treated with 3-BrPA plus CQ compared to cells treated with 3-BrPA alone.

Because elevated ROS occurred in cells with suppressed autophagy, we investigated whether ROS inhibition influenced 3-BrPA-plus-CQ-mediated cell death.
('ROS', 'occurred in', 'cells with autophagy')
('ROS inhibition', 'influenced', 'cell death')

ROS formation was inhibited with the ROS scavenger N-acetyl cysteine (NAC) and cell viability was measured with an MTT assay.
('ROS formation', 'was inhibited with', 'ROS scavenger cysteine')

Cell morphology was observed and photographed under an inverted microscope (Figures ).
('Cell morphology', 'photographed under', 'microscope')

Our data indicate that cell sensitization to 3-BrPA- and CQ-induced completely blocked cell death when ROS formation was inhibited.

In addition, the mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), an indicator of ROS generation, was detected in these cells using JC-1 [].
('membrane potential', 'was detected in', 'cells')

Higher MMP was observed in the control culture group compared to the dually treated groups (Figure ).
('MMP', 'was observed in', 'control culture group')

With co-treatment with 3-BrPA and CQ, JC-1 revealed higher green fluorescence, while adding NAC makes MMP turn to be higher again.

(Figure ).

ROS production contributes to 3-BrPA- and CQ-induced cell death in breast cancer cells

(A) MDA-MB-435 cells and MDA-MB-231 cells were treated with 320 μM 3-BrPA and 160 μM 3-BrPA respectively, and/or with 40 μM CQ for 12 h.

CQ enhanced anti-tumor efficacy of 3-BrPA in nude mice
('CQ', 'enhanced', 'efficacy')

To ascertain whether a combination of 3-BrPA and CQ could suppress tumor growth, MDA-MB-231 xenografts were examined.
('combination', 'could suppress', 'tumor growth')

Tumors continued to grow in xenografted mice treated with vehicle, CQ, or 3-BrPA, or a combination of CQ and 3-BrPA.
('Tumors', 'continued to grow in', 'mice treated with vehicle')

The combination of CQ plus 3-BrPA prevented tumor growth (Figure ).
('combination of CQ', 'prevented', 'tumor growth')

After treatment ended, mice were sacrificed, and tumors were excised and evaluated.

Tumor weights of mice treated with vehicle, CQ, and 3-BrPA alone were greater than those from mice treated with CQ plus 3-BrPA (Figure ).
('Tumor weights of mice treated with vehicle', 'were greater than', 'those from mice treated with CQ')

Hematoxylin and eosin (HE) staining indicated greater necrotic areas in CQ plus 3-BrPA-treated mice.
('Hematoxylin', 'indicated', 'areas in CQ mice')

DISCUSSION

The present study demonstrates that exposure of breast cancer cells to 3-BrPA induces autophagy and that CQ enhances the anti-tumor efficacy of 3-BrPA, both in vitro and in vivo.
('exposure of breast cancer cells', 'induces', 'autophagy')
('exposure of breast cancer cells', 'enhances', 'efficacy')
('CQ', 'enhances', 'efficacy')

The lethal effect of 3-BrPA in combination with CQ is initially triggered by the development of ROS-dependent autophagy induced by 3-BrPA, and then inhibition of autophagy and subsequent induction of mitochondrial depolarization and more ROS production, resulting in two different forms of cell death in MDA-MB-435 cells and MDA-MB-231 cells.
('effect', 'is triggered by', 'development of autophagy induced')

The roles of autophagy within the context of cancer are controversial.

One view is that autophagy suppresses tumor progress; another view is that autophagy is a pro-survival pathway.
('autophagy', 'suppresses', 'tumor progress')
('autophagy', 'is', 'pathway')

Inactivation of the autophagy-specific gene, Beclin-1, produces significantly higher frequencies of spontaneous malignancies in mice [].
('Inactivation of gene', 'produces', 'frequencies of malignancies in mice')

Muhammad's group showed that palmitic acid triggers Ca2+-dependent autophagy, which results in programmed necrotic death (necroptosis) in endothelial cells [].
('acid', 'triggers', 'Ca2')

However, autophagy may also be a pro-survival pathway assisting tumor cells to endure metabolic stress under nutrient/oxygen-deficient conditions and resist death triggered by chemotherapeutic agents.
('autophagy', 'be', 'pathway assisting tumor cells')

Xu's group showed that accumulation of autophagosomes in breast cancer cells induced

TRAIL resistance through downregulation of surface expression of death receptors 4 and 5 [].

Wang's laboratory reported that reduced miRNA MIR23B increases ATG12 and autophagy to promote radioresistance in pancreatic cancer cells [].

An analysis of the transcriptional status of ATG12 in &gt; 50 breast cancer cell lines suggested that the ATG12 transcript is commonly upregulated in trastuzumab-unresponsive HER2-overexpressing breast cancer cells [].
('ATG12 transcript', 'is upregulated in', 'breast cancer cells')

Here, we report that 3-BrPA had different effects in two breast cancer cell lines (Figure ) although autophagy occurred after drug treatment in both lines (Figure ).
('autophagy', 'occurred after', 'drug treatment in lines')

Autophagy inhibitors CQ and 3-MA used during 3-BrPA treatment revealed that CQ and 3-MA enhanced 3-BrPA-induced cell death in both cell lines (Figure ).
('CQ', 'enhanced', 'cell death')

Then, siRNA-mediated knockdown of Atg7 sensitized cells to 3-BrPA treatment (Figure ).

Thus, autophagy played a protective role during 3-BrPA treatment.

Autophagy can prevent apoptosis [], necrosis [], and necroptosis [].
('Autophagy', 'can prevent', 'apoptosis')

We used z-VAD-fmk to rule out the contribution of pan-caspases in 3-BrPA plus CQ-induced cell death.

z-VAD rescued 3-BrPA plus CQ-induced cell death in MDA-MB-435 cells but exacerbated cell death in MDA-MB-231 cells.

Furthermore, MDA-MB-231 underwent necrotic cell death after 3-BrPA plus CQ treatment, as evidenced by EM.

Thus, necrosis is the predominant mode of cell death in this line.
('necrosis', 'is', 'mode of cell death')

Finally, Nec-1 rescued 3-BrPA plus CQ-induced cell death in MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-435 cells.

These findings strongly suggest that 3-BrPA plus CQ induce necroptosis in MDA-MB-231 cells.

RIPK1 is a multi-functional protein also known to mediate NF-κB and caspase-8 activation in response to TNF-α[].

The pro-apoptotic function of RIPK1 is the formation of a caspase-8 activation complex in response to TNF receptor I activation [].
('function of RIPK1', 'is', 'formation of activation complex')

RIPK1 was also reported to be important for triggering necroptosis [].

In our study, knockdown of RIPK1 rescued both two cells from 3-BrPA plus CQ-induced cell death.
('knockdown of RIPK1', 'rescued', 'cells')

In addition, knockdown of other known contributors to programmed necrosis, such as RIPK3, only rescued MDA-MB-231 cells from 3-BrPA-induced cell death.
('knockdown of contributors to necrosis', 'rescued', 'cells')

Interestingly, 3-BrPA plus CQ induces apoptosis in MDA-MB-435 cells, but induces necroptosis in MDA-MB-231 cells, and all require RIPK1.

These data suggest a potential for novel strategies for the treatment of breast cancer.
('data', 'suggest', 'potential for strategies for treatment of breast cancer')

Autophagy induction after mitochondrial damage can lead to ROS production [].
('Autophagy induction after damage', 'can lead to', 'ROS production')

ROS, at the physiological level, are important for a variety of cellular programs of physiological and pathological conditions.
('ROS', 'are important for', 'variety of programs of conditions')

However, aberrantly high ROS are intimately associated with disease and are commonly observed in cancer [].
('ROS', 'are associated with', 'disease')
('ROS', 'are observed in', 'cancer')

ROS regulate autophagy by multiple mechanisms that involve direct effects on Atg protein Atg4 [], affecting the activity of the master autophagy regulator mTORC1 [].
('ROS', 'regulate', 'autophagy')

ROS are also implicated in autophagy induction in cancer therapy [], suggesting that ROS are important with respect to the mechanism of actions of cancer chemotherapeutics.
('ROS', 'are important with', 'respect to mechanism of actions of cancer chemotherapeutics')
('ROS', 'are implicated in', 'autophagy induction in cancer therapy')

Deregulation of ROS formation is associated with cancer initiation, progression, and drug resistance.
('Deregulation of ROS formation', 'is associated with', 'cancer initiation')

In our study, inhibition of autophagy led to an increase in ROS formation and blocking ROS accumulation with NAC rescued 3-BrPA plus CQ-induced cell death (Figure ), suggesting that ROS accumulation is an important mechanism in the sensitization of cells to death when autophagy is suppressed.
('inhibition of autophagy', 'led to', 'increase in ROS formation')
('inhibition of autophagy', 'blocking', 'ROS accumulation')
('ROS accumulation', 'is', 'mechanism in sensitization of cells')

In summary, 3-BrPA-induced autophagy in breast cancer cells may function as a resistance mechanism against cell death.
('autophagy in breast cancer cells', 'may function as', 'resistance mechanism against cell death')
