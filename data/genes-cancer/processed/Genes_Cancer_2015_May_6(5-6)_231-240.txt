INTRODUCTION
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the fifth most common cancer in men and the ninth most common cancer in women, and it is the second leading cause of cancer related death worldwide [].
The mechanisms involved in HCC remain unclear.
Accumulations of genetic and epigenetic changes are regarded as important mechanisms for many cancers [-].
Aberrant epigenetic changes have been frequently found in human HCC [-].
The Ras-association domain family (RASSF) proteins are associated with Ras-like small GTP binding proteins and participate in a range of cellular processes including cell growth, adhesion, migration, differentiation and apoptosis [, ].
The family of genes comprises 10 members that are subdivided into C-terminal (RASSF1-6) and N-terminal (RASSF7–10) RASSF genes [].
The C-terminal RASSF proteins harbor Ras association domains and Salvador/RASSF/Hippo (SARAH) domains in the C-terminus, whereas the N-terminal RASSF proteins contain Ras association domains in the N-terminus and lack the SARAH domain [].
RASSF10 is located on chromosome 11p15.2 [].
Loss of heterozygosity (LOH) frequently occurs in this region in several types of cancer [-].
RASSF10 is frequently methylated in many human cancers [, , -].
Our previous study found that RASSF10 suppresses colorectal cancer growth by activating P53 signaling.
In this study, we explored the epigenetic changes and the role of RASSF10 in HCC progression.
RESULTS
RASSF10 is silenced by promoter region hypermethylation in HCC cells
The expression of RASSF10 was detected in HCC cell lines by semi-quantitative RT-PCR.
As shown in Figure , loss of RASSF10 expression was found in SNU387, HBXF344, HepG2, PLC/PRF/5, Huh7, BEL7402, LM3, QGY7703, SNU449, SMMC7721, BEL7404, BEL7405, Sk-hep1, QSG7701 and Huh1 cells and reduced expression was found in SNU182 and SNU475 cells.
RASSF10 was highly expressed in DKO cells.
Promoter region methylation was detected by methylation specific PCR (MSP).
Complete methylation was found in SNU387, HBXF344, HepG2, PLC/PRF/5, Huh7, BEL7402, LM3, QGY7703, SNU449, SMMC7721, Sk-hep1, Huh1, BEL7404, BEL7405 and QSG7701 cells, partial methylation was found in SNU182 and SNU475 cells, and unmethylation in DKO cells (Figure ).
These results demonstrated that loss or reduced expression of RASSF10 correlated with promoter region methylation.
Treatment with the DNA methylation transferase inhibitor 5-aza-2′-deoxycytidine (5-aza) restored RASSF10 expression in SNU387, HBXF344, HepG2, PLC/PRF/5, Huh7, BEL7402, LM3, QGY7703 SNU449, SMMC7721, Sk-hep1, Huh1, BEL7404, BEL7405 and QSG7701 cells and increased RASSF10 expression in SNU182 and SNU475 cells (Figure ).
The above results suggest that RASSF10 expression is regulated by promoter region methylation.
To further validate the efficiency of the MSP primers and the methylation density in the promoter region, sodium bisulfite sequencing (BSSQ) was performed in SNU182, SHU475, HepG2, QGY7703 and DKO cells.
The BSSQ results were consistent with the MSP results (Figure ).
As shown in Figure  and , the direct effect of 5-aza induction of RASSF10 expression was validated by MSP and BSSQ after 5-aza treatment in SNU182, SHU475, HepG2 and QGY7703 cells.

RASSF10 is frequently methylated in human primary hepatocellular carcinoma
To determine the methylation status of RASSF10 in human primary HCC, 69 cases of primary HCC and 20 cases of normal liver tissue samples were examined by MSP.
RASSF10 was methylated in 82.6% (57/69) of primary HCC samples, but no methylation was detected in normal liver tissue samples (Figure ).
As shown in Table , methylation of RASSF10 was significantly associated with tumor size (P &lt; 0.05) and tumor stage (P &lt; 0.05), but no association was found between RASSF10 methylation and age, gender, HBV infection, cirrhosis, lymph node metastasis and cell differentiation.
The expression of RASSF10 was evaluated by immunohistochemistry (IHC) in 31 cases of available matched primary HCC and adjacent tissue samples.
Staining of RASSF10 was mainly localized in the cytoplasm and its expression was significantly reduced in primary HCC compared to adjacent tissue samples (p&lt;0.05, Figure ).
In 31 cases of available primary hepatic cancer samples, loss or reduced expression of RASSF10 was found in 24 cases.
Of these 24 case samples, 22 cases were methylated and 2 cases were unmethylated.
Loss or reduced expression of RASSF10 was significantly associated with promoter region hypermethylation (p&lt;0.05, Figure ).
These results indicate that RASSF10 expression is regulated by promoter region methylation in primary HCC.

Restoration of RASSF10 expression suppresses proliferation of HCC cells
To evaluate the effects of RASSF10 on HCC progression, cell viability and colony formation assays were employed.
As shown in Figure , cell viability was determined by the MTT assay.
The OD values were 0.498 ± 0.017 vs. 0.432 ± 0.021 (P&lt;0.05) in HepG2 cells and 0.519 ± 0.028 vs. 0.320 ± 0.014 (P&lt;0.05) in QGY703 cells before and after restoration of RASSF10 expression.
The cell viability was significantly reduced.
The colony numbers were 121 ± 8 vs. 64 ± 4 in HepG2 cells and 362 ± 22 vs. 222 ± 34 in QGY7703 cells before and after re-expression of RASSF10.
The colony number was significantly reduced after re-expression of RASSF10 in HCC cells (all P&lt;0.05, Figure ).
These results demonstrate that RASSF10 suppresses the proliferation of HCC cells.

RASSF10 induces G2/M phase arrest and sensitizes HCC cells to docetaxel
The role of RASSF10 in the cell cycle was analyzed by flow cytometry.
As shown in Figure , the distribution of cell phase in RASSF10 unexpressed and re-expressed HepG2 cells was 64.22 ± 3.0% vs. 54.57 ± 0.7% in G0/G1 phase, 22.88 ± 0.3% vs. 24.96 ± 1.1% in S phase and 12.9 ± 2.7% vs. 20.48 ± 1.7% in G2/M phase.
In QGY7703 cells, the cell phase distribution was 54.65 ± 0.4% vs. 42.26 ± 1.8% in G0/G1 phase, 31.54 ± 1.3% vs. 35.28 ± 2.1% in S phase and 13.81 ± 1.0% vs. 22.45 ± 0.5% in G2/M phase before and after restoration of RASSF10 expression.
The G0/G1 phase was significantly reduced and the G2/M phase was significantly increased before and after re-expression of RASSF10 in HCC cells (all P&lt;0.05).
The G1/S checkpoint was not obviously affected by RASSF10, as S phase was not changed significantly (P&gt;0.05).
The effect of RASSF10 on the arrest of the G2/M checkpoint was further validated by detecting G2/M phase related proteins in HCC cells.
The expression levels of cyclin B1 and cdc-2, important G2/M checkpoint regulators, were dramatically reduced after re-expression of RASSF10 in HepG2 and QGY7703 cells (Figure ).

*P &lt;0.05.
Docetaxel, a microtubule inhibitor, exerts its effects on the G2/M checkpoint.
To determine whether RASSF10 is involved in docetaxel sensitivity, we examined the cell viability of RASSF10 unexpressed and re-expressed HepG2 and QGY7703 cells after treatment with docetaxel.
The IC50 of docetaxel was 2.759 ± 0.079 vs. 1.008 ± 0.066 μg/ml (P &lt; 0.05) in HepG2 cells and 4.115 ± 0.172 vs. 2.044 ± 0.144 μg/ml (P &lt; 0.05) in QGY7703 cells before and after re-expression of RASSF10 (Figure ).
These results indicate that RASSF10 sensitizes HCC cells to docetaxel.
RASSF10 induces cell apoptosis and suppresses HCC cell growth by activating P53 signaling
To explore the role of RASSF10 in apoptosis, flow cytometry was performed.
The percentage of apoptotic cells was 3.26 ± 0.66% vs 10.31 ± 2.38% in HepG2 cells (P&lt;0.05) and 5.37 ± 0.16% vs 14.26 ± 3.00% in QGY7703 cells (P&lt;0.05) before and after re-expression of RASSF10.
These results suggest that RASSF10 induced cell apoptosis in HCC cells (Figure ).
To further explore the mechanisms of RASSF10 in HCC cell apoptosis, survivin, capase-3, cleaved capase-3, P21 and bcl-2 levels were examined by western blot before and after re-expression of RASSF10.
The expression levels of cleaved capase-3 and P21 were increased, while surviving, capase-3 and bcl-2 were reduced after re-expression of RASSF10 in HepG2 and QGY7703 cells (Figure ).

Our previous study reported that RASSF10 suppresses colorectal cancer growth by activating P53 signaling [].
To understand the mechanism of RASSF10 in HCC, MDM2, P53, P21, bcl-2 and BAX, the key components of P53 signaling, were examined by western blot before and after re-expression of RASSF10 in HepG2 and QGY7703 cells.
The expression levels of P53, P21 and BAX were increased, and MDM2 and bcl-2 were reduced after re-expression of RASSF10 (Figure ).
These results indicate that P53 signaling is activated by RASSF10 in HCC cells.
To further validate the growth inhibiting effect of RASS10 by activating p53 signaling, siRNA knockdown technique was applied in RASSF10 highly expressed DKO cells.
As shown in Figure , the expression of P53, P21 and BAX were reduced, MDM2 and bcl-2 were increased by knocking down RASSF10.
The results further suggest that RASSF10 suppresses HCC cell growth by activating p53 signaling.
DISCUSSION
RASSF10 has been reported to be frequently methylated in different malignancies and is regarded as a tumor suppressor [, -, ].
However, the mechanism of RASSF10 in human HCC remains unclear.
Our study found that RASSF10 was frequently methylated in human HCC and its expression was regulated by promoter region methylation.
Methylation of RASSF10 was associated with tumor size and stage.
Restoration of RASSF10 suppressed cell proliferation and induced apoptosis in human HCC.
It has been reported that knockdown of RASSF10 increases mitosis in A549 lung cancer cells [].
Our previous study also found that RASSF10 induces G2/M arrest in human colorectal cancer and esophageal cancer [, ].
The effects of RASSF10 on G2/M arrest were verified in human HCC in this study.
The sensitivity of HepG2 and QGY7703 cells to docetaxel increased after re-expression of RASSF10.
These results suggest that methylation of RASSF10 may serve as a docetaxel resistant marker in human HCC.
Similar to our previous study in human colorectal cancer, RASSF10 suppressed human HCC proliferation by activating p53 signaling.
In conclusion, RASSF10 is frequently methylated in human HCC and the expression of RASSF10 is regulated by promoter region methylation.
Methylation of RASSF10 is associated with tumor size and TNM stage, and it may serve as a docetaxel resistant marker in human HCC.
RASSF10 suppresses human HCC growth by activating P53 signaling.
