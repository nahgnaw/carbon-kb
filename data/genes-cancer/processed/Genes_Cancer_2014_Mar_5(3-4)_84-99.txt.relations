INTRODUCTION

Cell migration is critical for both cellular homeostasis and development.
('Cell migration', 'is critical for', 'homeostasis')

It is regulated by a complex signaling network involving a coordinated interactions among large array of signaling and cytoskeletal structural proteins[] [, ].

Aberrant cell migration has been shown to be associated with many different pathological conditions including cancer cell metastasis[].
('cell migration', 'has been shown to be associated with', 'conditions including cancer cell metastasis')

There has been intensive focus in the recent years to identify critical molecules that enable the invasive migration of cancer cells.

In this context, it is of interest to note here that our previous studies have identified a pivotal role for Hax-1 in the migration of neoplastically transformed NIH3T3 cells[].
('studies', 'have identified', 'role')

Hax-1 was initially identified as an anti-apoptotic protein that interacts with Hematopoetic Cell-specific Lyn Substrate-1 (HCLS1/HS-1) [].

The observations that HCLS1/HS-1 is a hematopoietic cell-specific homolog of cortactin and HCLS1/HS1 as well as cortactin is critically involved in cell migration [-] suggested a role for Hax-1 in cell migration.
('observations', 'is', 'homolog of cortactin')
('homolog of cortactin', 'is involved in', 'cell migration')

Subsequent studies from several laboratories including ours have clearly established a crucial role for Hax-1 in cancer cell migration [, -].
('studies from laboratories including ours', 'have established', 'role')

More recently it has been shown that Hax-1 is overexpressed in many cancers and the increased expression of Hax-1 can be correlated with aggressive cancer metastasis[-].
('expression', 'can be correlated with', 'cancer metastasis')

Collectively these studies point to a novel, but yet to be resolved role for Hax-1 in tumor cell migration and metastasis.
('studies', 'point to', 'novel')

Our previous studies focused on identifying the role of Hax-1 in invasive cell migration regulated by the oncogenic heterotrimeric G protein, G13, have indicated the possible role of Hax-1 in facilitating the formation of a multi-protein complex consisting of Gα13, cortactin, and Rac1[].
('studies', 'focused on', 'identifying role')

Several studies including ours have characterized the molecular basis for the interaction of Hax-1 with different proteins including Gα13 and cortactin.
('studies including ours', 'have characterized', 'basis for interaction')

However, the structural and functional requirement for Hax-1 in Rac1-cortactin mediated signaling machinery involved in cell migration - especially with reference to cancer cell migration and metastasis - has not been fully understood.

The most critical spatiotemporal cytoskeletal events regulated by Rac1 are membrane ruffling[] and lamellipodia formation[, ].
('events regulated by Rac1', 'are', 'membrane ruffling')

Essentially, Rac1 stimulates the formation of lamellipodia at the leading edges of migrating cells by coordinating F-actin and Arp2/3 interaction[-].

A critical mechanism by which Rac1 mediates this process is through the translocation of cortactin to the cell periphery where cortactin promotes the nucleation of Arp2/3-F-Actin interaction as well as the stabilization of the assembled Arp2/3-F-actin network and lamellipodia[, , -].
('mechanism', 'is through', 'translocation of cortactin')
('cortactin', 'promotes', 'nucleation of interaction')

Thus, the dynamic interaction between Rac1 and cortactin plays a pivotal role in cell migration [, -].
('interaction between Rac1', 'plays', 'role')

However, the possible role of any scaffold protein that can modulate the dynamic interaction between Rac1 and cortactin is thus far not clarified.

Based on our previous findings that Hax-1 is in complex with Rac1 as well as cortactin, it can be hypothesized that Hax-1 facilitates the interaction between Rac1 and cortactin, thus functioning as a scaffold protein for their interaction.

In testing this hypothesis, we report here that Hax-1 shows an increased expression in ovarian cancer cells and silencing of Hax-1 critically impairs the migration of the representative SKOV3 cells in response to LPA.
('silencing', 'impairs', 'migration of SKOV3 cells')

We also show that Hax-1 is required for the interaction between Rac1 and cortactin.

Focusing on identifying the domain(s) of Hax-1 required for its interactions with cortactin and Rac1, we demonstrate here that the interaction between Hax-1 and cortactin primarily involves two domains named Hax-D1 and Hax-D3 spanning amino acids 1 to 56 and amino acids 113-168 respectively.
('interaction', 'involves', 'domains named')

A weaker cortactin-interacting domain of Hax-1 (Hax-D4) defined by amino acids 169 to 224.

Hax-1 interaction with Rac1 involves two distinct domains of Hax-1 that spans amino acids 57-112 (Hax-D2) and 169-224 (Hax-D4).
('interaction with Rac1', 'involves', 'domains')

Our results also indicate that the competitive inhibition of the interaction between endogenous Hax-1 and Rac1 or Hax-1 and cortactin by the ectopic expression of any of these domains led to a decrease in LPA-stimulated migration of ovarian cancer cell line SKOV3.
('inhibition of interaction', 'led to', 'decrease in migration of cancer cell line SKOV3')

More significantly, the expression of Hax-D4, which shows interaction with both Rac1 and cortactin, acutely inhibited LPA-stimulated colocalization of Rac1 and cortactin thereby attenuating LPA-stimulated migration of these cells.
('expression', 'inhibited attenuating', 'colocalization of Rac1')

Thus, the results presented here define a critical scaffolding role for Hax-1 in LPA-stimulated Rac1-cortactin interaction and subsequent ovarian cancer cell migration.

RESULTS

Silencing of Hax-1 attenuates LPA-mediated migration of SKOV3 cells.
('Silencing', 'attenuates', 'migration of SKOV3 cells')

Our previous studies have shown that Hax-1 is critically required for the invasive cell migration stimulated by the gep protooncogene, Gα13 [].

Our studies have also demonstrated that LPA-stimulated Gα13 promotes the migration of cancer cell lines including those of ovarian cancer [, ].

Therefore, we first sought to investigate whether the expression of Hax-1 is increased in ovarian cancer cells in which Gα13-signaling plays a major role in invasive cell migration.
('expression', 'is increased in', 'cancer cells')

Lysates from a panel of ovarian cancer cells including SKOV3, HeyA8, OVCAR3, 2008, OVCA429 cells and control human ovarian surface epithelial cells (HOSE) were subjected to immunoblot analysis using antibodies specific to Hax-1.
('Lysates from panel of cancer cells including SKOV3', 'were subjected to', 'immunoblot analysis using antibodies')

Results from such an analysis clearly indicated that the expression of Hax-1 was increased in ovarian cancer cell lines compared to HOSE cells (Figure ).
('expression', 'was increased in', 'cancer cell lines')

The elevated levels of expression of Hax-1 seen in ovarian cancer cells along with its previously established role on cell migration prompted us to investigate the role of Hax-1 in LPA or FBS stimulated migration of ovarian cancer cells.
('levels of expression', 'prompted to investigate', 'us')
('role', 'stimulated', 'migration of cancer cells')

This was carried out using SKOV3 cells in which the expression of Hax-1 was transiently silenced.

Two shRNA constructs, sh-Hax #1 and sh-Hax #3 that could efficiently silence Hax-1 were chosen for these analyses (Figure ).

Equal number of SKOV3 cells (1×106), expressing sh-Hax #1, sh-Hax #3, or scrambled, non-specific shRNA-control RFP vector, were subjected to a standard “wound-healing” assay in the presence of 20 μM LPA, or 10% FBS along with appropriate controls.
('Equal number of SKOV3 cells expressing', 'were subjected to', 'assay in presence of mM LPA')

The results indicated that the silencing of Hax-1 drastically inhibited LPA- or serum-stimulated migration of SKOV3 cells compared to the control cells (sh-NS) expressing scrambled shRNA (Figure ).
('silencing', 'inhibited', 'LPA migration of SKOV3 cells')

To test the role of Hax-1 in LPA- or serum-stimulated invasive migration of these cells, we monitored the migration of Hax-1-silenced SKOV3 cells using a Collagen I-coated TransWell invasion assay.

Similar to the results obtained from the wound-healing assay, LPA- as well as FBS-stimulated invasive migration of ovarian cancer cells was significantly attenuated by the silencing of Hax-1 (Figure ).
('migration of cancer cells', 'was attenuated by', 'silencing')

Together, these data establish a dominant role for Hax-1 in LPA stimulated invasive migration of ovarian cancer cells.

These transfectants were unstimulated (SS), stimulated with LPA (20 μM), or FBS (10%) and their migratory responses were monitored as described under Materials and Methods.

At 24 hours following stimulation, images were obtained from random fields of view at 10X magnification.

Silencing of Hax-1 disrupts Rac1- cortactin interaction and localization
('Silencing', 'disrupts', 'Rac1 localization')

Our previous studies have indicated that Hax-1 is part of a signaling complex consisting of Gα13, cortactin, and Rac1[].

It is well established that Rac1 plays a critical role in cell migration through its interaction with cortactin [, , ].

Upon stimulation by serum or specific ligands, it has been observed that Rac1 interacts with cortactin and the resultant Rac1-cortactin complex translocates to the leading edges of migrating cells to stabilize Arp2/3-actin nucleation complex involved in lamellipodia formation [, , ].

Based on our previous finding that, Hax-1 exists in a complex with Rac1 as well as cortactin, both of which coimmunoprecipitate with Hax-1, it can be reasoned that Hax-1 is involved in promoting Rac1-cortactin interaction.

To verify such a role for Hax-1, we examined the colocalization of Rac1 and cortactin in Hax-1-silenced SKOV3 cells using immunofluorescence analysis.

As shown in Figure , a robust interaction between Rac1 and cortactin could be seen in control SKOV3 cells (sh-NS).

Whereas, cells in which Hax-1 was silenced exhibited a significantly reduced colocalization of Rac and cortactin (Figure ).
('cells', 'exhibited', 'colocalization of Rac')

Quantification of colocalization substantiated this further (Figure ).

We also carried out coimmunoprecipitation analysis using the lysates from these cells, to test whether the silencing of Hax-1 leads to a reduction in the physical association between Rac1 and cortactin.
('silencing', 'leads to', 'reduction in association between Rac1')

As shown in Figure , the levels of Rac1 coimmunoprecipitated with cortactin were greatly reduced in lysates from Hax-1-silenced SKOV3 cells compared to the control cells.
('levels of Rac1 coimmunoprecipitated with cortactin', 'were reduced in', 'lysates from SKOV3 cells')

Similarly, the levels of cortactin coimmunoprecipitated with Rac1 were reduced in Hax-1 silenced cells.
('levels of cortactin coimmunoprecipitated with Rac1', 'were reduced in', 'cells')

The observation that the expression levels of Rac1 and cortactin remained unchanged with the silencing of Hax-1 indicated that the reduced levels of coimmunoprecipitated Rac1 and cortactin were not due to changes in the expression levels of either of these proteins.
('expression levels of Rac1', 'remained', 'unchanged')
('levels of Rac1', 'were not due to', 'changes in expression levels of either of proteins')

Together, these results (Figure ) demonstrate a novel role for Hax-1 in facilitating the interaction between Rac1 and cortactin.
('results', 'demonstrate', 'role')

('Silencing', 'attenuates', 'complex formation')

(A) SKOV3 cells in which the expression of Hax-1 was silenced by shRNA to Hax-1 (sh-Hax #1 and sh-Hax #3) and the control cells expressing non-specific shRNA (shNS) were sequentially immunostained with primary mouse monoclonal Rac1 (1:200) antibody for 1h, washed, incubated with secondary Alexa 647-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (1:200, Red) for 1h washed and then stained with Alexa 488-conjugated anti-mouse Cortactin (Millipore, MA) antibody for 1h (1:200, Green).

('graph', 'represents', 'percentage of cells')
('transfection efficiency', 'was calculated as', 'ratio of transfected to cells')

(C) For the quantitative determination of the Rac1-cortactin colocalization, Pearson's correlation coefficient (PCC) calculated using JACoP (Just Another Colocalization Plugin) for each transfection condition was normalized to the vector control transfection.
('correlation coefficient calculated using JACoP', 'was normalized to', 'vector control transfection')

Average of the normalized PCC is represented as a graph and the statistical significance was assessed using one-tailed t-test (*p &lt;0.1 and ** p&lt;0.05).

At 48 hours following transfection, 1mg of the cellular proteins was immunoprecipitated with cortactin (Left Panel) or Rac1 (Right Panel) antibodies.

Immunoprecipitates were resolved by SDS-PAGE and immunoblot analysis was carried out to detect the coimmunoprecipitation of Rac1 or cortactin respectively along with Hax-1.
('Immunoprecipitates', 'were resolved by', 'analysis')

('blots with antibody', 'served to monitor', 'loading of protein')

The experiments were repeated at least three times and the presented results are from a typical experiment.

Hax-1 interacts with cortactin and Rac1 via distinct regions

The observation that the silencing of Hax-1 led to a reduction in the levels of colocalized Rac1 and cortactin underscored the need to define the interaction of Hax-1 with these proteins further.
('observation', 'underscored', 'need to define interaction')
('silencing', 'led to', 'reduction in levels of Rac1')

Our previous studies have shown that the immunoprecipitation of an epitope-tagged full-length Hax-1 brings down both cortactin and Rac1[].
('immunoprecipitation', 'brings', 'cortactin Rac1')

Therefore, we carried out studies to identify the domains of Hax-1 involved in the interaction with cortactin and Rac1 using a GST-fusion protein pull-down assay strategy.

A sequential series of cDNA inserts encoding fifty-six amino acids of Hax-1 (Figure ) were ligated to a cDNA insert encoding GST protein by PCR methods and were utilized for the expression of GST-fused domains of Hax-1 in E. coli.
('series of cDNA inserts encoding amino acids', 'were ligated to', 'cDNA insert encoding GST protein')
('series of cDNA inserts encoding amino acids', 'were utilized for', 'expression of domains')

GST-Hax-1-Sepharose beads generated from these constructs (Figure ), namely Hax-D1 (amino acids 1-56), Hax-D2 (amino acids 57-112), Hax-D3 (amino acids 113-168), Hax-D4 (amino acids 169-224), and Hax-D5 (amino acids 225-279), were used to pull down cortactin or Rac1 from the lysates prepared from SKOV3 cells.
('beads generated from constructs', 'were used to pull', 'cortactin Rac1')

As shown in Figure , two major cortactin-interaction domains of Hax-1 could be mapped to amino acids 1-56 (Hax-D1) and 113-168 (Hax-D3).

In addition, a much weaker interaction site was mapped to a site spanning amino acids 169-279 (Hax-D4).
('interaction site', 'was mapped to', 'site spanning amino acids')

Analyses of GST-Hax-1-Rac1 interactions indicated that the major interaction sites for Rac1 were amino acids 57-112 (Hax-D2) and 169-224 (Hax-D4).
('interaction sites for Rac1', 'were', 'amino acids')

Relatively weaker interaction sites for Rac1 could be mapped to other regions of Hax-1 spanning amino acids 1-56 (Hax-D1) and 225-279 (Hax-D5) (Figure ).
('interaction sites for Rac1', 'could be mapped to', 'regions')

Thus, the results presented here identifies for the first time that Hax-1 interacts with cortactin and Rac1 via specific as well as overlapping domains.
('results presented', 'identifies for', 'time')

Hax-1 interacts with cortactin and Rac1 via distinct regions.

(A) Hax-D1, Hax-D2, Hax-D3, Hax-D4, and Hax-D5 domain constructs, labeled D1, D2, D3, D4, and D5, comprising of 56 consecutive amino acids, were cloned by PCR methods in pGEX 5x-1 vector.

(B, C) The GST-D1-D5 Sepharose beads were prepared using protocols as discussed under Materials and Methods section from the GST-Hax-D1-D5 domain constructs.
('Sepharose beads', 'were prepared using', 'protocols')

2 mg of SKOV3 lysate protein obtained using previously published procedures were incubated with the GST- D1, GST-D2, GST-D3, GST-D4, and GST-D5 Sepharose beads for 4 hours at 4°C.

The beads were washed five times with chilled GST-lysis buffer, and eluted in SDS sample-loading buffer.

Expression of Cortactin- and Rac1-interacting domains inhibits the migration of SKOV3 Cells
('Expression of Cortactin', 'inhibits', 'migration of SKOV3 Cells')

Results from the in vitro binding assays described above indicate that Hax-1 interacts with both Rac1 and cortactin through non-overlapping as well as overlapping domains.

Therefore, it can be reasoned that Hax-1 brings together Rac1 and cortactin through this interaction during cell migration.

In such an event, the expression of cortactin- or Rac1-interacting Hax-1-domain would inhibit cell migration by competing with the endogenous Hax-1 in its interaction with cortactin and/or Rac1.
('expression of cortactin', 'would inhibit', 'cell migration')

To investigate, we analyzed the migratory potential of SKOV3 cells expressing the different Hax-1 domains.

As shown in Figure , expression of these domains blunted the migratory potential of SKOV3 cells by varying levels (Figure ).

However, more pronounced inhibitory effect on cell migration was observed with the expression of the Hax-D4.
('effect on cell migration', 'was observed with', 'expression')

The inhibitory effects of Hax-D4 on migration were quantified to be &gt; 75% (Figure ).

We confirmed the equal expression of the HA-tagged Hax-1 domains by immunostaining (Figure ) and immunoblotting for the HA-epitope along with appropriate quantification (Figure ).

Previous studies have shown that lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) plays a major role in ovarian cancer pathobiology by promoting the invasive migration of ovarian cancer cells [, -].
('acid', 'plays', 'role')

Therefore, it can be predicted that LPA-stimulated migration involves Hax-1 mediated complex formation involving Rac1 and cortactin.
('migration', 'involves', 'complex formation involving Rac1 cortactin')

To test, we monitored whether LPA stimulates the interaction between Rac1 and cortactin and if so, whether the expression of Rac1/Cortactin-interacting Hax-D4 would abrogate such LPA-mediated Rac1-cortactin association.

SKOV3 cells transfected with control vector (VC) or vector encoding Hax-D4 were serum-starved for 16 hours, following which they were stimulated with 20 μM LPA for 24 hours.

The transfectants were subjected to immunofluorescence imaging by probing them with antibodies specific to Rac1 or cortactin along with specific fluorophore-tagged second antibodies.

Results from such analyses indicated that the cells stimulated with LPA showed an increase in Rac1-cortactin complexes, indicated by their broad colocalization (Figure ).

More interestingly, the expression of the Hax-D4 drastically inhibited such complex formation stimulated by LPA (Figure ).

('blot', 'reprobed with', 'antibody to GAPDH')

Based on the observation that Hax-D4 inhibits LPA-stimulated Rac1-cortactin colocalization, it can be predicted that the Hax-4 would inhibit LPA-stimulated migration.

To test, SKOV3 cells (1×106) expressing the control vector or Hax-D4 were subjected to a cell migration assay in the presence of 20 μM LPA along with appropriate controls.
('SKOV3 cells expressing control vector', 'were subjected to', 'cell migration assay in presence of mM LPA')

Results from such analysis indicated that while LPA stimulated the migration of vector control SKOV3 cells, the expression of Hax-D4- drastically inhibited the migration of SKOV3 cells in response to LPA (Figure ).
('LPA', 'stimulated', 'migration of vector control SKOV3 cells')
('expression', 'inhibited', 'migration of SKOV3 cells')

To make sure that the observed inhibitory effect on Rac1-cortactin colocalization and cell migration is not due to an altered expression of Rac1 or cortactin, their expression profiles were monitored along with that of the ectopically expressed Hax-D4 (Figure ).
('effect on colocalization', 'is not due to', 'expression of Rac1')
('expression profiles', 'were monitored along', 'with')

Together with the findings that Hax-D4 can interact with both Rac1 and cortactin (albeit weakly), these results indicate that Hax-D4 disrupts LPA-stimulated Rac1-cortactin colocalization and cell migration by competitively inhibiting the interaction of Hax-1 with Rac1 and cortactin.

DISCUSSION

Hax-1 was initially identified as HS-1 or HCLS1–interacting protein in a yeast two hybrid screen.

Subsequent studies have identified its interaction with many different proteins involved in different cellular responses such as cell survival, anti-apoptosis, and cell migration.
('studies', 'have identified', 'interaction with proteins involved in responses')

Recently, it has also been observed that the homozygous mutations in Hax-1 gene or loss of Hax-1 are associated with severe congenital neutropenia and neurodevelopmental disorders.
('mutations in gene', 'are associated with', 'neutropenia')
('loss', 'are associated with', 'neutropenia')

In addition, overexpression of Hax-1 has been observed in tissues from esophageal, lung and colon cancers [, , , ].
('overexpression', 'has been observed in', 'tissues from esophageal cancers')

More significantly, in colorectal cancer the increased expression of Hax-1 correlates with the lymph node metastasis and poor prognosis of the patients[].
('expression', 'correlates with', 'lymph node metastasis')

While all these studies point to a determinant role for Hax-1 in critical signaling pathways involved in cell growth, differentiation, apoptosis, tumorigenesis and tumor cell migration, the functional role played by Hax-1 in these diverse cellular responses are far from clear.
('studies', 'point to', 'determinant role')

The findings that Hax-1 interacts with HS1 and cortactin[] that are involved in cell migration[, , , , ] provided the initial evidence that Hax-1 could be involved in cell migration.

In this context, our previous observation that Hax-1 is required for the migration of NIH3T3 cells stimulated by the activated, oncogenic mutant of Gα13 is highly significant.

These studies suggested that Gα13, upon activation by its cognate receptor(s), associates with Hax-1 in a complex containing Hax-1, Rac1 and cortactin.

Based on these findings, we proposed that Hax-1 could provide a physical conduit for transmitting the signals from the oncogenic G protein to cellular cytoskeletal machinery through its interactions with cortactin.

While the structural basis for the association of Hax-1 with Gα13 and cortactin is well characterized, such an understanding has been lacking for the interaction between Hax-1 and Rac1.
('understanding', 'has lacking for', 'interaction')

It has also remained unclear whether the interaction of Hax-1 with Rac1 would have any bearing on the Rac1-cortactin interaction involved in cytoskeletal changes associated with cell migration.
('interaction', 'would have', 'bearing on interaction involved in changes associated with cell migration')

Results from our studies presented here attempts to clarify these points in addition to providing novel insights into the role of Hax-1 in cell migration.
('Results from studies presented', 'attempts to clarify', 'points')

We demonstrate here that the expression of Hax-1 is highly elevated in a panel of ovarian cancer cells and the silencing of Hax-1 inhibited basal as well as serum- or LPA-stimulated migration by more than 50%.
('expression', 'is elevated in', 'panel of cancer cells')
('expression', 'inhibited', 'basal migration')
('silencing', 'inhibited', 'basal migration')

The inhibition was more acutely observed when invasive migration of SKOV3 cells in which Hax-1 was silenced was monitored using collagen I coated TransWell invasion assay.
('migration of SKOV3 cells', 'was monitored using', 'collagen')

Although a role for Hax-1 in metastasis has been speculated based on its expression profile in metastatic cells [, , , ], the results presented here provide the first evidence that Hax-1 is critically required for the invasive migration of an ovarian carcinoma cell line in response to both LPA and serum growth factors.
('results presented', 'provide', 'evidence')

In light of the findings that LPA plays a dominant role in ovarian cancer cell migration, the observation that LPA-stimulated migration requires Hax-1 is quite significant.
('LPA', 'plays', 'role')

It should be noted here that the studies carried out in several laboratories, including ours, have established Hax-1 as a non-enzymatic protein that interacts with multiple protein partners in different cellular or physiological contexts.

Thus, it appears that Hax-1 behaves more like a scaffold protein involved in the nucleation of different multi-protein complexes in a cellular or physiological context specific manner.

Our interrogation of Hax-1 based on this reasoning clearly substantiates such a view.
('interrogation based on reasoning', 'substantiates', 'view')

Results from coimmunoprecipitation analyses clearly indicate that Hax-1 is required for the physical association between Rac1 and cortactin.

This is further supported by the in vivo colocalization analysis in which the silencing of Hax-1 drastically reduces the colocalization of Rac1 and Hax-1.
('silencing', 'reduces', 'colocalization of Rac1')

Next, our analysis of Hax-1 domains involved in its interactions with Rac1 and cortactin clearly indicates that the primary domains of Hax-1 involved in its interactions with Rac1 and cortactin are different.

Our studies on mapping the cortactin-interacting sites of Hax-1 further refines this, by indicating that the cortactin-interacting sites of Hax-1 are interspersed in the N-terminus.

Two primary cortactin-interacting sites span amino acids 1-56 (Hax-D1) and 113-168 (Hax-D3).
('sites', 'span', 'amino acids')

In addition, Hax-D4 domain defined by amino acids 169-224 shows a weaker interaction with cortactin.
('domain defined by amino acids', 'shows', 'interaction with cortactin')

The weaker interaction of Hax-D4 with cortactin could be due to the possibility that the cortactin-interacting site of Hax-1 extends beyond Hax-D3 and into the contiguous sequences of Hax-D4.

In the case of Rac1 interaction, the primary sites through which Hax-1 interacts with Rac1 involve amino acids 57-112 (Hax-D2) and 169-224 (Hax-D4).
('sites', 'involve', 'amino acids')

Although the folding of these domains in relation to the tertiary structure of Hax-1 is not known at present, the non-overlapping sites (Rac1-specific Hax-D2 and cortactin-specific Hax-D3) involved in cortactin and Rac1 interaction suggest the interesting possibility that Hax-1 can interact with both the molecules using different domains so that they are brought into close proximity with each other for functional interaction.
('sites involved in cortactin interaction', 'suggest', 'possibility')

Further analyses using shorter deletion constructs or mutational scanning should provide more details on Rac1- and cortactin-specific domains of Hax-1.
('analyses using deletion constructs scanning', 'should provide', 'details on domains')

It can be anticipated that the ectopic expression of Hax-1-domains that interact with either cortactin or Rac1, would inhibit cell migration by competitively inhibiting the interaction of endogenous Hax-1 with cortactin and/or Rac1.
('expression', 'would inhibit', 'cell migration')

This view is substantiated by our studies in which the expression of cortactin- as well as Rac-interacting Hax-1-domains inhibited the migration of SKOV3 cells at varying extents.
('expression of cortactin', 'inhibited', 'migration of SKOV3 cells')
('view', 'is substantiated by', 'studies')

However, more potent inhibition of cell migration was observed with the expression of Hax-D4.
('inhibition of cell migration', 'was observed with', 'expression')

When these domains were analyzed for their effect on Rac1-cortactin colocalization, only Hax-D4 was observed to acutely inhibit the colocalization.
('domains', 'were analyzed for', 'effect on colocalization')

The inhibitory effect seen only with Hax-D4 could be due to the ability of Hax-D4 to interact with both Rac1 and cortactin.
('effect seen', 'could be due to', 'ability to interact with Rac1')

Although Hax-D4 shows a weaker interaction with cortactin compared to Rac1, it is likely that Hax-D4, through its bivalent interaction, competitively and effectively sequesters both Rac1 and cortactin, thus preventing them from interacting with each other.

The fact that the observed inhibitory effects of Hax-D4 are quite similar to the effects seen with the silencing of Hax-1 (Fig. ), strongly supports the conclusion that the primary function of Hax-1 in cell migration is to facilitate the interaction of cortactin and Rac1 as a scaffolding protein.
('effects', 'are similar to', 'effects seen with silencing')

Taken together with our previous observations that LPA-stimulated migration of ovarian cancer cells require Gα13-regulated Rac-activation [, ] and activated Gα13 promotes the formation of a Hax-1-Rac1-cortactin signaling complex [], the present observation that Hax-1 is required for Rac1-Cortactin interaction establish a critical role for Hax-1 in scaffolding the interaction between Rac1 and cortactin (Fig. ). At present, it is not clear whether Hax-1 is required only for the nucleation of Rac1-cortactin interaction or if it is also required for the subsequent steps in cell migration including Rac1-mediated translocation of cortactin to lamellipodia and Rac1-cortactin-mediated stabilization of actin polymerization in lamellipodia.

However, these speculated roles for Hax-1 need not be mutually exclusive.

Further studies should define the processive events involving Hax-1, Rac1, cortactin and other binding partners during cell migration and metastasis.
('studies', 'should define', 'events involving')

In summary, our results conclusively establish for the first time that Hax-1 is critically required for the Rac1-cortactin interaction and subsequent invasive migration of ovarian cancer cells.
('results', 'establish for', 'time')

Schematic model for the scaffolding function of Hax-1.

LPA, upon binding to one or more LPA receptors, activates Gα13 to stimulate the invasive migration of carcinoma cell lines [, ]; Gα13 in turn stimulates Hax-1[] and Hax-1, thus stimulated by the upstream LPA-LPAR signaling promotes the interaction of Rac1 and cortactin through specific domains (see text).
('LPA', 'activates', 'Ga13')

Hax-1 mediated interaction between Rac1 and cortactin is required for LPA-stimulated migration of the ovarian carcinoma cell line, SKOV3.

The role of Hax-1 in subsequent molecular events during cell migration remains to be clarified.
