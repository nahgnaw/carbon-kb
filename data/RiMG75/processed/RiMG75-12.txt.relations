Diamonds and the Geology of Mantle Carbon

INTRODUCTION TO DIAMOND CHARACTERISTICS

Introduction

Earth’s carbon, derived from planetesimals in the 1 AU region during accretion of the Solar System, still retains similarities to carbon found in meteorites  even after 4.57 billion years of geological processing.
(carbon derived from planetesimals in AU region, retains, similarities to carbon found in meteorites)

The range in isotopic composition of carbon on Earth versus meteorites is nearly identical and, for both, diamond is a common, if volumetrically minor, carbon mineral .

Diamond is one of the three native carbon minerals on Earth (the other two being graphite and lonsdaleite).

It can crystallize throughout the mantle below about 150 km and can occur metastably in the crust.

Diamond is a rare mineral, occurring at the part-per-billion level even within the most diamondiferous volcanic host rock although some rare eclogites have been known to contain 10-15% diamond.
(Diamond, is, mineral occurring at level)
(eclogites, have been known to contain, diamond)

As a trace mineral it is unevenly distributed and, except for occurrences in metamorphosed crustal rocks, it is a xenocrystic phase within the series of volcanic rocks (kimberlites, lamproites, ultramafic lamprohyres), which bring it to the surface and host it.

The occurrence of diamond on Earth’s surface results from its unique resistance to alteration/dissolution and the sometimes accidental circumstances of its sampling by the volcanic host rock.
(occurrence of diamond, results from, resistance to alteration/dissolution)

Diamonds are usually the chief minerals left from their depth of formation, because intact diamondiferous mantle xenoliths are rare.
(Diamonds, are, chief minerals left from depth of formation)

Diamond has been intensively studied over the last 40 years to provide extraordinary information on our planet’s interior.
(Diamond, has been studied over, years)

For example, from the study of its inclusions, diamond is recognized as the only material sampling the “very deep” mantle to depths exceeding 800 km  although most crystals (~95%) derive from shallower depths (150 to 250 km).
(crystals, derive from, depths)
(diamond, is recognized as, material sampling)

Diamonds are less useful in determining carbon fluxes on Earth because they provide only a small, highly variably distributed sample that is usually not directly related to the host magma.
(Diamonds, are useful in, determining carbon fluxes)

One major achievement in our understanding of diamond formation both in Earth’s mantle and metamorphic rocks is the increasing evidence for its formation from a mobile C-bearing phase, commonly referred to as “C-O-H-bearing fluid or melt”.
(achievement in understanding of diamond formation, is, evidence for formation from phase referred)

These free fluids give diamond the remarkable ability to track carbon mobility in the deep mantle, as well as mantle mineralogy and mantle redox state and hence a unique ability to follow the path and history of the carbon from which diamond is composed.
(fluids, give, ability to track carbon mobility)

Thus, diamond truly occupies a unique position in any discussion of the igneous and metamorphic aspects of Earth’s carbon cycle.
(diamond, occupies, position in discussion of aspects of carbon cycle)

Beyond simply providing deep samples, diamond studies have revealed active geodynamics.

These studies have pinpointed the initiation of subduction , tracked the transfer of material through the mantle transition zone , recorded the timing of ingress of fluids to the continental lithosphere , preserved carbonatitic fluids that trigger deep mantle melting , captured the redox state of the mantle , and provided samples of primordial noble gases .
(studies, have pinpointed, initiation of subduction)

The present chapter does not attempt to review all aspects of diamond studies—for this an entire volume of Reviews in Mineralogy and Geochemistry would be required.
(chapter, does not attempt to review, aspects of diamond studies)

For summaries on the various aspects of diamond mineralogy, geochemistry, and formation, the reader is referred to works by Harris and coworkers (1968, 1979, 1992), Sobolev and others (1977, 1990),  Gurney and others (2010), Pearson and coworkers (1999, 2003),      .
(reader, is referred to, works by Harris)

Rather, this chapter will review the key observations and the current state of research on naturally occurring diamonds using modern methods of analysis as they apply to diamond formation, the source of carbon-bearing species in the mantle, the role of carbon during mantle melting, and the geologic history of the mantle with emphasis on the main difficulties to be unlocked in future studies.
(chapter, will review, observations state of research source of species in mantle role of carbon history of mantle)

Types of diamond.

For a cubic mineral of simple composition, diamond displays a remarkable range of properties.
(diamond, displays, range of properties)

Diamond also displays a variety of shapes reflecting growth under variable conditions of supersaturation and resorption.
(Diamond, displays, variety of shapes reflecting growth under conditions of supersaturation)

These characteristics have been covered in recent popular books and articles on diamond (e.g.    ).
(characteristics, have been covered in, books)

For the geological purposes of tracing the history of C-bearing fluids it is important to consider the three main forms in which diamond occurs: polycrystalline, monocrystalline, and coated (Fig. 1).

Polycrystalline diamond includes many subtypes of mantle-derived diamonds (e.g., framesite, bort, ballas), some of unknown origin (e.g., carbonado), and some impact diamonds (e.g., yakutite).
(Polycrystalline diamond, includes, subtypes of diamonds)

Most studied mantle-derived polycrystalline diamonds fall into two main categories: 1) framboids of diamond crystals sintered together without silicates (bort); and 2) as diamondite, fine to medium-grained rocks composed of subequal amounts of silicate minerals (typically garnet and pyroxene but lacking olivine) and diamond.
(polycrystalline diamonds, fall into, categories)

Monocrystalline diamond is micro (<0.5 mm) to macro (>0.5 mm) single-crystal diamond from which gem diamonds are cut and polished.

Often these monocrystals display a complicated internal growth history with episodes of resorption and regrowth (Fig. 1) as well as simple composite forms (e.g., twin forms such as macles and intergrowths).
(monocrystals, display, growth history)

Monocrystalline diamonds have been an important source of inclusions for study and the ages of these diamonds have been determined via geochronology on their inclusions as Proterozoic to Archean.
(Monocrystalline diamonds, been, source of inclusions)
(source of inclusions, have been determined via, geochronology on inclusions)

Coated diamonds are a special case of of mixed polycrystalline-monocrystalline diamond, where monocrystals have been overgrown by a thick, cloudy, polycrystalline coat laden with microinclusions of fluid.
(diamonds, are, case of of)
(monocrystals, have been overgrown by, coat)

If the coat is composed of rods or blades of diamond (Fig. 1) it will exhibit a fibrous structure and be termed a fibrous diamond.
(coat, is composed of, rods)

These coats are believed to grow during transport in the kimberlite and thus represent young, new diamond growth surrounding often ancient diamond (e.g. ).
(coats, are believed to grow during, transport in kimberlite)

More research to date has been on monocrystals because they are more available for study, are less complicated morphologically, and are the most robust hosts for mineral inclusions.
(research to date, has been on, monocrystals)

Diamond parental and host rocks.

Diamonds are chiefly carried to Earth’s surface in only three rare types of magmas: kimberlite, lamproite, and lamprophyre (e.g., ).
(Diamonds, are carried to, surface)

Of the three types, kimberlites are by far the most important, with several thousand known, of which some 30% are diamondiferous.
(kimberlites, are by, important)

A similar percentage of the several hundred known lamproites is diamondiferous and diamonds are occasionally recorded from ultramafic lamprophyres.
(percentage of lamproites, are recorded from, lamprophyres)
(diamonds, are recorded from, lamprophyres)

Lamproites are next in importance to kimberlites because they host the world’s largest diamond mine, Argyle (Australia), and notable diamond occurrences in the United States and India.
(Lamproites, are, next in importance to kimberlites)

Lamprophyres currently are only of petrological interest as hosting the oldest known diamonds, which occur in Wawa, Ontario.

In general, these magma types are derived by small amounts of melting deep within the mantle, are relatively volatile (H2O, CO2, F, or Cl) and MgO-rich, erupt rapidly, and are not oxidizing.
(magma types, are derived by, amounts of melting)

In nearly all cases of magmatically-hosted diamonds, Archean to Proterozoic diamonds are carried by Phanerozoic to younger (Cretaceous/Tertiary) kimberlitic volcanic rocks .
(Archean to Proterozoic diamonds, are carried by, Phanerozoic)

The composition of kimberlitic magmas can vary widely depending the relative proportions disaggregated mantle xenoliths, phenocryst phases such as olivine and assimilated country rock, the ratio of H2O to CO2 in the volatile phase, and the extent of interaction with metasomatic minerals in the subcontinental lithospheric mantle.

Of great importance for diamond petrogenesis the distinction between Group I (GI) and Group II (GII) kimberlites as diamond carriers.

Generally, GI kimberlites contain normal (i.e., non-metasomatic) mantle minerals and initial isotopic compositions for Sr, Nd, Hf, and Pb that are indicative of equilibration chiefly with the convecting mantle, whereas GII kimberlites contain micaceous and metasomatic minerals and extreme isotopic compositions for Sr, Nd, Hf, and Pb that are indicative of equilibration with the metasomatized subcontinental lithospheric mantle (e.g., ).
(GI kimberlites, contain, mantle minerals compositions)
(GII kimberlites, contain, minerals compositions)

Within the mantle, eclogite and peridotite are the main parental rocks of diamonds, as the loose monocrystalline diamonds seen in kimberlite are considered to have been released from eclogitic or peridotitic hosts by alteration and mechanical disaggregation during sampling by the kimberlitic magma in the lithosphere or early transport by the kimberlite .
(eclogite, are, rocks of diamonds)
(peridotite, are, rocks of diamonds)
(rocks of diamonds, are considered to been released from, hosts)

Both diamondiferous and diamond-free eclogites often survive transport by kimberlite, whereas diamondiferous peridotite is exceptionally rare and nearly all peridotite xenoliths are diamond-free.
(eclogites, survive, transport by kimberlite)

The physical distribution of diamond in eclogite has been studied recently by CAT-scan techniques, which have revealed that diamonds are often found in between the major silicate phases in their host eclogite and often along pathways where metasomatic fluids traveled .
(diamonds, are found in, between)

Presumably diamond in peridotite has a similar textural relationship to its major silicates; however, the ready reaction of CO2-rich diamond-forming fluids with abundant magnesian silicates to form friable magnesite (MgCO3) along silicate grain boundaries promotes disaggregation of the xenoliths and release of the diamonds, thus destroying the textural relationship with their host.
(diamond in peridotite, has, relationship to silicates)
(reaction of fluids with silicates to form magnesite, promotes, disaggregation of xenoliths release of diamonds)

In the crust, diamonds are found directly within their host lithologies, which have been exhumed by the orogenic process of continental collision [1].

These occurrences are typically in carbonate-bearing rocks, and/or those that have been subjected to the flow of water/carbonate-bearing metamorphic fluids as can be seen by infrared spectroscopy showing fluid inclusions with carbonates, silicates, hydroxyl groups, and water (e.g., de ).

In the Kokchetav massif, northern Kazakhstan, for example , these hosts include garnet-biotite gneisses and schists, which make up 85 vol% of the rocks with the remainder being dolomite, Mg-calcite, garnet, and clinopyroxene in different proportions.
(Kazakhstan, include, gneisses schists)
(hosts, include, gneisses schists)
(remainder, being, dolomite)

Other high-pressure terranes contain diamond as multiphase inclusions coexisting with minerals such as garnets, K-clinopyroxene, magnesite, high-Si phengite, and coesite.
(terranes, contain, diamond)

In many cases, these inclusions appear to be shielded from retrogression by garnet, zircon, or kyanite, showing the significance of the host minerals as containers of UHP mineral inclusions and their significance in the search for further diamondiferous metamorphic rocks.
(inclusions, appear to be shielded from, retrogression)

In the Erzebirge terrane, Germany, diamond occurs within all three host minerals in a muscovite-quartz-feldspar rock .
(diamond, occurs within, host minerals)

In the Western Gneiss terrane, Norway, diamond is enclosed exclusively with spinel in garnet that occurs within garnet-websterite pods ( van ), whereas in the Dabie Shan and North Quaidem areas, China, diamond occurs with coesite and jadeite within garnet or zircon in eclogite, garnet pyroxenite, and jadeite .
(diamond, occurs with, coesite)

Diamond formation also occurs during the high pressures and temperatures produced when an extraterrestrial body impacts Earth’s surface (impact diamonds).
(Diamond formation, occurs during, pressures produced)

Given the short time scales, diamond formation occurs within either C-rich targets (graphite to diamond solid-state transition) or impact melts .

Impact diamonds can reach up to 1 cm size in the well-studied Popigai impact crater  but diamonds are typically much smaller (submicron to millimeter in size).

Lonsdaleite, the hexagonal-form of sp3-bonded carbon , is characteristic of impact diamonds.
(Lonsdaleite, is characteristic of, impact diamonds)

Although somewhat rare in nature, impact diamond and lonsdaleite could actually be spread over Earth’s entire surface, as illustrated by their occurrence at the K/T boundary layer.
(impact diamond, could be spread over, surface)
(lonsdaleite, could be spread over, surface)

Impact diamonds are comparatively little studied and have been mostly used to identify the occurrence of large impacts .
(Impact diamonds, have been used to identify, occurrence of impacts)

Diamond distribution in Earth.

At depths below about 150-200 km along both continental and oceanic geothermal gradients, the entire Earth, including the base of the continental lithosphere and the convecting mantle beneath the lithosphere-asthenosphere boundary, is in the diamond stability field (e.g.,  Fig. 2).
(Earth, is in, diamond stability field)

Locally, given the typically low solubility of C in mantle silicate and oxides, there is the potential to crystallize diamond within a large volume of Earth’s mantle in the presence of a free C-bearing phase such as methane or carbonate.

But under the conditions of typical plume-related magmatism and relatively slow transport to the surface, diamonds will re-equilibrate, either graphitize or more likely oxidize.

With few exceptions diamonds are erupted only by kimberlite and lamproite magma and such volcanism is rare.

Thus, the true amount of diamond crystallizing at depth in Earth below the lithosphere is not known but could be much larger than what has erupted with kimberlite.

When these diamonds are exhumed from below the continental lithosphere, they are referred to as superdeep or sub-lithospheric diamonds, whereas if they are derived from within the continental lithosphere they are referred to as lithospheric (Fig. 2).
(diamonds, are exhumed from, below)

Crustal diamonds that occur in high-pressure metamorphic terranes are known as “ultra-high-pressure metamorphic” or UHPM diamonds for the amazingly high pressures that they signify for crustal conditions.
(diamonds, are known as, diamonds for pressures)

Note that all mantle diamonds form at higher pressures than UHPM diamonds.
(mantle diamonds, form at, pressures than UHPM diamonds)

The point here is that diamond is a good tracer mineral for carbon throughout the mantle and crust.
(diamond, is, tracer mineral for carbon)

Geologic setting for diamond formation.

At Earth’s surface, macro-diamonds are highly unevenly distributed, being found primarily within erupted kimberlite with a direct association to stable Archean continental nuclei ( Fig. 3).

Beneath the seismically stable, old, interior portions of cratons, the lithospheric mantle extends from about 40 km depth down to perhaps 250-300 km, whereas under the oceans it is thinner and extends from about 40 km to only about 110 km (e.g.,  1978; ).
(mantle, extends from, km depth)

Because of the downward protruding shape and the long-term attachment of this mantle to the continental crust of the craton, this portion of mantle has taken the term “mantle keel” (Fig. 2).

Archean lithospheric keels are more melt-depleted and deeper than Proterozoic and younger continental mantle keels and their lowermost reaches are squarely in the diamond stability field (e.g.,  Fig. 2).

They are the most diamond-friendly regions of Earth and their depth is thought to facilitate the production of kimberlitic magma by deepening the onset of melting of carbonated mantle.
(depth, is thought to facilitate, production of magma)

This connection produces an amazingly strong association between diamondiferous kimberlite and the oldest interior portions of continental nuclei having the most melt-depleted mantle keels a relationship that is known as “Clifford’s Rule” (e.g.,  ).
(connection, produces, association between kimberlite)

This association is so strong that it has proved to be the most essential consideration in diamond exploration; its corollary is the complete absence of macrocrystalline diamonds in the oceanic mantle.
(corollary, is, absence of macrocrystalline diamonds)

Diamonds found in kimberlite provide a recent snapshot of their occurrence at depth in the mantle because most kimberlites are relatively young.
(Diamonds found in kimberlite, provide, snapshot of occurrence)

Nonetheless, if the diamonds are ancient (e.g., billions of years older than the kimberlite) their compositions can record the active geological processes that initially placed the diamondiferous fluids into the lithosphere.
(compositions, can record, processes)

Thus diamonds alone can provide a record of the carbon cycle older than the oldest oceanic lithosphere (e.g >200 Ma), especially in the Archean and Proterozic, when major changes in Earth’s geodynamics, crustal growth, and atmospheric chemistry occurred.
(diamonds, can provide, record of carbon cycle)

The oldest diamonds yet dated are thought to be intimately associated with initial production of the depleted mantle keel itself either in the plume upwelling and attendant melting that is responsible for the extensive depletion (e.g., ), or in some closely-associated recycling (e.g., ) and advective thickening (e.g.,  1978).
(diamonds dated, are thought to be associated with, production of mantle keel)

They potentially track some of the oldest carbon-bearing fluids released by Earth.

Once formed, the keel is not just a passive player in diamond genesis.
(keel, is, player in diamond genesis)

During continental collision the keel can capture eclogite (e.g., ) and trap fluids emanating from any underthrusted oceanic lithosphere (e.g., ).
(keel, can capture, eclogite)

During the supercontinent cycle, orogenesis around ancient continental nuclei may permit marginal subduction to repeatedly add diamond-forming fluids generated from tectonic processes near the edges of cratonic blocks (e.g.,  ) or orogenesis may even rework the lithosphere beneath mobile belts, in some cases recycling the extant carbon that is part of much older mantle lithosphere (e.g., ).
(orogenesis around nuclei, may permit to add, subduction)

Diamonds formed in association with continental tectonism record geologic processes from the deepest portions of the continents and can be key to understanding the stabilization of the continents.

Persistent, sub-lithospheric magmatism can also be a source of heat and fluids to add diamonds to the interior of cratons from below.
(magmatism, be, source of heat to add diamonds)

The continental keels provide the only evidence for the source, timing, and geological causes of such ancient deep carbon.
(keels, provide, evidence for source timing causes of carbon)

Crustal diamonds from ultra-high-pressure (UHP) metamorphic terranes record the fate of carbon trapped at much shallower levels in the lithosphere.
(diamonds from terranes, record, fate of carbon trapped at levels in lithosphere)

Diamonds found in these crustal settings are often cubic and microcrystalline and occur with metamorphic mineral assemblages that can be used to trace the diamond-forming reactions.
(Diamonds found in settings, occur with, mineral assemblages)

Here we have the converse of Clifford’s Rule in that these diamonds are chiefly forming in Paleozoic to Cenozoic orogenic belts, where extreme conditions of continental tectonic instability have allowed the crustal section to be buried to the diamond stability field and later exhumed (e.g.,   Fig. 3).
(diamonds, are forming in, Paleozoic)
(conditions of instability, have allowed to be buried, section)

Although the study of  highlighted the occurrence of some mantle-derived rare gases, there is no doubt that, for the vast majority of UHP diamonds, the carbon reservoir is crustal, apparently isolated from mantle carbon.

The crustal source of carbon is evident from the association of the diamonds with metasedimentary protoliths, the unusual chemical composition of their fluids (e.g.,  2006), and their high-N content (up to 1 wt%) or heavy δ15N ( 2010) that are not found among mantle-derived diamonds.
(source of carbon, is evident from, association of diamonds)

Microscale components in diamonds

The advent of microanalytical techniques, such as secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS), laser ablation inductively-coupled plasma mass spectrometry (LA-ICPMS), focused ion beam lift out (FIB), high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and high-intensity light sources (synchrotron), have revolutionized the ability to look at the diamond itself even beyond the way that the electron microprobe (EPMA) revolutionized mineral analysis in the 1960’s.
(advent of techniques, focused, ion beam lift transmission electron microscopy scanning electron microscopy sources)
(electron microprobe, revolutionized, mineral analysis)

Not only can ever smaller inclusions be found and imaged, but their chemical and isotopic compositions can be determined in some instances.
(chemical, can be determined in, instances)
(compositions, can be determined in, instances)

Elemental substitution.

The substitution of elements into the diamond structure has long been an area of study because of its effect on the gem qualities, and hence value, of natural diamond and its effect on the physio-chemical properties of diamond.
(substitution of elements, been, area of study)

The first quantitative measurements of trace elements in diamonds were published by .

More than 60% of elements in the periodic table can be found in diamond but chiefly it is only nitrogen, boron, hydrogen, silicon, and nickel that substitute into the diamond structure (e.g.,  ) in routinely measurable quantities.

Nitrogen is the main substitutional diamond impurity  and, for historical reasons , it forms the basis of diamond classification into so-called Type I (nitrogen-bearing) and Type II (nitrogen so low as to be thought of as essentially nitrogen-free) diamond.
(Nitrogen, is, diamond impurity)
(Nitrogen, forms, basis of diamond classification)

With modern instrumentation it proves possible to detect traces of N in diamonds that previously would have been termed Type II.

suggest defining type II as <20 ppm N, but this value may decrease in the future.
(value, may decrease in, future)

In diamond, nitrogen occurs as different N-bearing centers, the most abundant (A, B, C defects) being again on the basis of the diamond classification into IaA, IaB, and Ib diamond respectively (e.g.,  ).
(nitrogen, occurs as, centers A)

A second-order diffusion process  leads C-centers (single substitution N-defect) originally present in the diamond matrix to migrate to form A-defects (N-pairs) and subsequently B-defect (cluster of 4 N-atoms around a vacancy).

This difference can best be ascertained by infrared (IR) spectroscopy (e.g., ).
(difference, can be ascertained by, spectroscopy)

The abundance of N-bearing diamonds vary from one locality to the other.
(abundance of diamonds, vary from, locality)

From published data, about 70% of diamonds contain > 20 ppm nitrogen and are classified as Type Ia, most (99.9%) being mixtures of IaA and IaB.

Early studies investigated the potential of N-aggregation to date mantle residence time of diamond, but appeared to be so sensitive to temperature  to make N-aggregation is actually a better thermometer .
(studies, investigated, potential)
(appeared, is, thermometer)

Consistency in diamond N-aggregation state is noticeable Metamorphic diamonds spent short residence times (typically a few Ma; ) at rather low temperatures (<1000 °C) and therefore display low-aggregation states (Ib-IaA diamonds).
(Consistency in diamond state, is, diamonds spent)
(Consistency in diamond state, display, states)

Fibrous diamonds and the coats of coated diamonds being related to the kimberlite magmatism also have short residence times (close to 1 Ma;  ), but at higher (i.e., mantle) temperatures and consistently display higher N-aggregation states (99% are IaA diamonds, plus some rare Ib-IaA diamonds; for review see  and references therein).
(diamonds being related to kimberlite magmatism, have, residence times)
(coats of diamonds, have, residence times)

Finally, having spent billions of years at mantle temperatures, xenocrystal eclogitic and peridotitic diamonds show higher aggregation states (>99.9% are IaA-IaB diamonds).

Transition zone and lower mantle are usually deprived in nitrogen (Type II) but the few type I deep diamonds are characterized by highly aggregated nitrogen (IaB diamond), reflecting their high-temperature environment ( and references therein).
(Transition zone, are deprived in, nitrogen)
(mantle, are deprived in, nitrogen)
(type, are characterized by, nitrogen)

For determining the source of the carbon in the fluids/melts that have crystallized diamond, –an essential aspect of carbon cycle research– the 13C/12C and 15N/14N isotopic compositions, and N abundance have emerged as the most important measurements ( and see stable isotope section below).
(aspect of carbon cycle research, have emerged as, measurements)
(N abundance, have emerged as, measurements)

These measurements can be done in bulk by gas source, isotope ratio mass spectrometry (IRMS) at high precision and accuracy or on individual spots by SIMS in spatial relationship to diamond growth zones at lower levels of precision and accuracy.
(measurements, can be done in, bulk)

Fractionation of both the C and N isotopic compositions occurs with diamond growth and active debate centers on the extent to which fractionation versus source reservoir composition controls the isotopic composition of a diamond .
(Fractionation of C, occurs with, diamond growth)
(fractionation, controls, composition of diamond)

Trace element analysis by LA-ICPMS recently has emerged as a powerful new tool for relating diamonds to the fluids/melts from which they have grown (see below).
(Trace element analysis, has emerged as, tool for relating diamonds)

But at current sensitivity and blank levels the trace elements analyzed by LA-ICPMS are in the micro-inclusions of cloudy and fibrous diamonds and are not direct constituents of the clear, gem-quality diamond lattice.
(trace elements analyzed, are, constituents of diamond lattice)

Fluid and micro-mineral inclusions.

For purposes of discussion, a distinction is being made here between discrete micro-inclusions located usually in the interior of gem-quality monocrystalline diamonds and suited for individualized X-ray, thermobarometric, chemical, and isotopic study (discussions in section below) and dispersed clusters and clouds of nano- to micro-inclusions that have been included during coated diamond growth or exsolved from melt after diamond crystallization.

Fibrous and coated diamonds can occur as single-crystal cubes (fibrous cuboids) or as the thick outer rim or coat on clear octahedral cores.

Some diamonds oscillate between fluid-poor (gem-quality, layer-by-layer growth) and fluid-rich, fibrous growth (e.g., Fig 1, top), whereas other have a center of fluid-rich fibrous growth that transforms into fluid-poor, gem diamond outwards (so-called “cloudy diamonds”).

The first published report of fluids in fibrous diamonds was made by  and early studies of their growth structures were made by  and .

Fibrous diamonds generally make up less than 1% of mine production but can comprise as much as 8% at some mines such as Jwaneng, Botswana , 90% in Mbuji Mayi Zaire, and 50% in Sierra Leone (see  for review).
(diamonds, make, % of mine production)

Typically, the compositions within any one diamond are uniform but significant variations exist between individual diamonds.
(variations, exist between, diamonds)

Fibrous diamonds have been the active research focus of Navon and coworkers for many years (e.g.   2011), as summarized by .
(diamonds, been, research focus of Navon)

The fluid compositions are typically measured for major elements by electron microprobe ( totals are typically <5% and are normalized to 100%) or FTIR , whereas INAA  and ICPMS (  2006;   2010;   ) are the preferred methods for trace element determinations.
(INAA, are, methods for trace element determinations)
(ICPMS, are, methods for trace element determinations)
(fluid compositions, are measured for, elements by electron microprobe)

In addition, radiogenic isotope characteristics can now be measured by novel applications (e.g., combustion, off-line laser ablation) of standard analytical techniques .
(isotope characteristics, can be measured by, applications)

The fluids range in composition from carbonatitic to hydrous and silicic end-members, with intermediate compositions ( Fig. 4).
(fluids, range in, composition from carbonatitic)

The carbonatitic fluid is rich in carbonate, CaO, FeO, MgO, and P2O5 with a magnesio-carbonatitic end-member  whereas the hydrous fluid is rich in SiO2, Al2O3 .
(fluid, is rich in, carbonate)
(fluid, is rich in, SiO2)

K2O contents are high in both fluid types.
(K2O contents, are high in, types)

In contrast, fluid inclusions from cloudy diamonds contain much higher Cl contents and are classified as brines, being distinct from the other fluid types found in fibrous diamonds .
(fluid inclusions from diamonds, contain distinct, Cl contents)
(fluid inclusions from diamonds, are classified as, brines)

The brines carry very little SiO2 (3-4 wt.%), possibly because of the low water content restricting the solvating capacity of the fluid.
(brines, carry, SiO2)

Recent work over the last decade has discovered fluids in diamonds (Fig. 4) from some localities (Diavik, Udachnaya, Kankan) that are carbonatitic and with high-Mg content (10 to 15 wt.%;   ).
(work over decade, has discovered, fluids in diamonds)

These fluids are capable of being in equilibrium with carbonated peridotite and thus represent a more primitive end-member perhaps existing deeper in the lithosphere and associated with the fluids in proto-kimberlitic magmas .
(fluids, are capable of, being in equilibrium with peridotite)

Their high alkali (K2O > 10 wt%) and Cl contents are thought to be too elevated to be completely primary and may suggest assimilation of these components .

Recent experimental work (e.g., ) has confirmed these studies of natural diamond by showing that hydrous silicate melt and aqueous fluid can coexist in regions of active diamond growth, though at higher pressures and temperatures these fluids become one supercritical fluid.
(work, has confirmed, studies of diamond)
(silicate, can coexist in, regions of diamond growth)
(fluid, can coexist in, regions of diamond growth)

These fluids crystallize cloudy and fibrous diamond with complex mixed-phase inclusions .
(fluids, crystallize, cloudy fibrous)

The concentration of incompatible elements of varying geochemical affinity (K, Na, Br, Rb, Sr, Zr, Cs, Ba, Hf, Ta, Th, U, and the light rare earth elements) in the fluid inclusions from fibrous diamonds is much higher than in typical mantle-derived magmas and phenocryst-hosted melt inclusions (  2011;  ).
(concentration of elements of affinity, is higher than, in)

Recent advancements in LA-ICPMS techniques (e.g., ) have permitted enough improvements in trace element measurements so that even Sr, Nd, and Pb isotopic compositions can now be determined (Fig. 5).
(advancements in techniques, have permitted, improvements in trace element measurements)

The concentrations of most trace elements decrease by a factor of two from the carbonate-rich fluids to the hydrous fluids, with the high-Mg carbonatitic fluids among the highest trace element content (e.g., ).
(concentrations of trace elements, decrease by, factor of two)

Rare earth element (REE) contents of the fluid inclusions are higher than those of kimberlites and lamproites but the fluids show very similar levels of extreme light REE enrichment over the heavy REE typical of these rock types.
(element contents of fluid inclusions, are higher than, those of kimberlites)
(fluids, show, levels of REE enrichment)

Negative anomalies in Nb, Sr, Zr, Hf, and Ti are typical (e.g.,    2011; ).

These features suggest that the fluids may be related to carbonatite- or kimberlite-like magmas in displaying a dominant metasomatic component in their source and fractionation of carbonate plus other phases such as rutile, and zircon.
(fluids, may be related to, carbonatite)

The amount of fractionation of these latter minerals must be small; otherwise middle REE and heavy REE systematics of the fluids would show distinctive fractionation effects.
(REE, would show, fractionation effects)

Early Sr isotope studies  and carbon isotope measurements ( 1992) supported a link between the fluids in fibrous diamonds and kimberlite-like magmas.
(Sr isotope studies, supported, link between fluids in diamonds)
(carbon isotope measurements, supported, link between fluids in diamonds)

But recent, more complete isotopic work  has shown that fluids in fibrous diamonds have Sr isotopic compositions too radiogenic and Nd isotopic compositions too unradiogenic to be related just to the kimberlite hosting the diamonds.

Generation of these fluids must also involve lithospheric components.
(Generation of fluids, must involve, components)

These fluids are thought to have been derived from mixing between an ancient component derived from the breakdown of micaceous phases in the lithosphere and carbonatitic-kimberlitic fluids from beneath the lithosphere .
(fluids, are thought to been derived from, mixing between component derived from breakdown of phases)

Nonetheless, the incompatible-element-rich nature of the fluids in fibrous diamonds illustrate that carbonate-rich and hydrous deep mantle fluids are efficient carriers of incompatible elements.
(mantle fluids, are, carriers of elements)

Despite the wide range of Sr and Nd isotopic compositions ( Fig. 5), the C and N isotopic compositions of all fibrous diamonds measured so far (summarized in  additional data in ) is very restricted and falls close to the canonical mantle values of -5‰, indicating a dominant source within the convecting mantle.

Most fibrous/fluid-rich diamonds and diamond coats are thought to have formed near the age of kimberlite eruption and hence have not experienced protracted mantle residence times on the basis of their unaggregated nitrogen (IaA diamonds) and the similarity of fluids to kimberlitic fluids.
(diamonds, are thought to formed near, age of eruption)
(diamond coats, are thought to formed near, age of eruption)

have recently analyzed fluids within fibrous diamonds from Wawa, Ontario, where the diamonds are thought to have been emplaced at Earth’s surface a minimum of 2.7 Ga ago.
(diamonds, are thought to been emplaced at, surface minimum of ago)

These authors find trace element systematics that are very similar to the fluids in “modern” fibrous diamonds.
(authors, find, trace element systematics)

This study is strong evidence for a similar parentage for these late Archean diamonds and those fibrous diamonds of today, and provides supporting evidence for a dominant style/source of diamond formation from the late Archean onwards as proposed by .

Transmission electron microscopy coupled with sample removed by focused ion beam lift-out (TEM, FIB;  2009) is increasingly being applied to the study of fluid- and inclusion-rich diamonds (e.g.,  2006, 2007;  2007b;  ).
(Transmission electron microscopy coupled with sample removed, is being applied to, study of fluid)

found abundant solid inclusions of carbonates, halides, apatite, and high-Si mica.

The TEM results, together with the narrow range of compositions measured by EPMA, along with the volatiles evident from infrared (IR) spectroscopy, suggest that the micro-inclusions trapped a uniform, dense, supercritical fluid and that the included nano-phases grew as secondary phases during cooling.

Kvasnytsya &  found nano-inclusions of typical lherzolitic silicates in micro-diamonds from the Ukraine, plus a number of likely epigenetic phases, such as graphite and K-richterite.

Fe-Sn oxides were also reported, whose primary origin is unclear.

The same study also revealed abundant nano-inclusions of carbonate, ilmenite, rutile, apatite, sylvite, and low-Si mica in fibrous microdiamonds.

This assemblage is consistent with formation of these diamonds from a carbonatitic to a slightly silicic melt, rich in alkali and volatile components, as proposed for other fibrous diamonds.
(assemblage, is consistent with, formation of diamonds to melt)

A single polycrystalline diamond aggregate from Orapa was studied by  who found a syngenetic micro- and nano-inclusion suite of magnetite, pyrrhotite, omphacite, garnet, rutile, and C–O–H fluid.
(polycrystalline diamond aggregate from Orapa, was studied by, found micro suite of magnetite O H fluid)

This assemblage led the authors to propose a novel redox reaction between carbonatitic melt and the sulfide-bearing eclogite during diamond crystallization.
(assemblage, led to propose, authors)

While fibrous and cloudy diamonds with their characteristically high abundances of a variety of inclusions were studied first, these techniques are being increasingly applied to clearer, monocrystalline stones as the only way to look at rare, exceedingly tiny inclusions in superdeep diamonds (e.g.,  2007;  2009;  ).
(techniques, are being applied to, stones as way to look at inclusions in diamonds)

Certain suites of superdeep diamonds have yielded a dazzling array of nano-inclusions although whether they are syngenetic remains to be proven.
(suites of diamonds, have yielded, array)

Some inclusions, such as halides, anhydrite, phlogopite, or hydrous aluminosilicate ( 2009) are unexpected in the mantle unless they have been introduced by deep recycling of volatile-enriched slabs.
(inclusions, are unexpected in, mantle)

Other superdeep inclusions, such as iron carbide and nitrocarbide , are providing primary evidence for the redox shifts due to the disproportionation of Fe3+ into perovskite, whereas nyerereite and nahcolite  suggest the existence of primary carbonatite associated with diamond formation (e.g., ).
(superdeep inclusions, are providing, evidence for redox shifts)
(nyerereite, suggest, existence of carbonatite associated with diamond formation)
(nahcolite, suggest, existence of carbonatite associated with diamond formation)

One expects that these techniques will be applied with more frequency to typical lithospheric monocrystalline diamonds of low inclusion abundance.
(techniques, will be applied with, frequency to monocrystalline diamonds of inclusion abundance)

In the end, it seems clear that such TEM and microanalytical studies will provide the answers to the questions of the speciation of diamond-forming fluids and the oxygen fugacity of the mantle regions in which diamond forms.
(TEM, will provide, answers to questions of speciation of fluids)
(studies, will provide, answers to questions of speciation of fluids)

Internal textures in diamonds

Diamonds show no growth zonation in visible light but display it in polarized light, photoluminescence, and cathodoluminesce (CL).
(Diamonds, show, no growth zonation in light)

The best technique for observations is CL, which has been widely applied to diamonds.
(technique for observations, is, CL)

In CL a beam of electrons generated in either an electron probe or a Luminoscope™ (a microscope-mounted CL instrument) can excite photons through electron transfer.

In diamonds this technique is best accomplished on polished plates, which must be oriented perpendicular to one of the {110} axes (e.g., not parallel to {100} or {111}; ).
(technique, is accomplished on, plates)

Nitrogen, the major diamond impurity, is the chief activator of CL in diamond.
(Nitrogen, is, activator of CL)

The technique has been widely applied to diamonds and dramatic images displaying a variety of growth textures (e.g., see Fig. 1) have been presented by  Kaminsky &  Spetsius &  and Tappert & .
(technique, has been applied to, diamonds)

Lithospheric diamond textures.

Despite the irregular forms that exist (macles, bort, etc.) most monocrystalline lithospheric diamonds have an internal structure that is roughly concentric.
(diamonds, have, structure)

The zoning patterns are characterized by two chief features: 1) extremely thin oscillations between stronger and weaker luminescence (Fig. 1c); and, 2) alternating episodes of resorption and overgrowth on top of the resorption (Fig. 1d).
(patterns, are characterized by, features)

Both features strongly support the idea that diamond grows from an aqueous fluid and/or low-viscosity melt with an aqueous component  rather than a solid medium such as graphite.
(features, support, idea)
(diamond, grows from, fluid)

Growth from graphite is not only energetically unfavorable for monocrystalline diamonds , but growth from graphite would likely not produce the internal diamond textures observed such as the fine oscillations (e.g., rapid change in N content) or periods of resorption between periods of growth.

Growth of polycrystalline diamonds directly from graphite is feasible, however .

The growth history revealed by CL is extremely important to the interpretation of individual mineral inclusions (e.g.,  1999b; ) and C and N isotopic composition changes during diamond growth (e.g.,    ).
(growth history revealed by CL, is important to, interpretation of mineral inclusions)

In combination with electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) and the FIB-SEM, CL can even be used to study the 3-dimensional growth zonation around inclusions in diamond.

In general, the ability to analyze individual inclusions and analyze C and N isotopes in-situ by SIMS has made it essential to use such techniques to guide the placement of in-situ analyses.
(ability to analyze inclusions, has made to use, techniques)
(analyze, has made to use, techniques)

Superdeep diamond textures.

The textures revealed in sub-lithospheric diamonds are strikingly different than those seen in lithospheric diamonds (   in press).
(textures, revealed in, diamonds)

External morphologies of such diamonds are not polycrystalline in the same way that lithospheric diamonds can be, yet they rarely form euhedral monocrystals either.
(morphologies of diamonds, are, polycrystalline in way)

In CL, regular concentric zonation is rare.

Instead, these diamonds (Figs.

1e, 1f) are characterized by multiple growth centers, non-concentric zonation of a blocky texture, and even what appears to be deformation texture; in short they display almost polycrystalline internal structures.

The major difference between sub-lithospheric diamonds compared to lithospheric diamonds is that they grow at much higher pressure and temperature and in a mantle that is actively convecting, whereas lithospheric diamonds grow in a mantle host that is not convecting.
(difference between diamonds, compared to, diamonds)
(diamonds, grow in, mantle host)

At present, it remains speculation as to whether these textural differences are caused by the dramatic differences in the nature of the host mantle or by the possibility that some growth from solid graphite (e.g., ) is favored by the much higher P-T conditions and deformation.
(differences, are caused by, differences in nature of host mantle)
(growth from graphite, is favored by, conditions)

DIAMOND FORMATION

Diamond formation in the mantle is generally considered to be a metasomatic process (e.g.,  ).

The agents of metasomatism, most likely supercritical fluids or melts, react with the mantle rocks in which they infiltrate, and diamond crystallizes as a consequence of the reduction of carbon via redox reactions, simple examples of which are:
(agents of metasomatism, react with, mantle rocks)
(agents of metasomatism, crystallizes as, consequence of reduction of carbon)
(diamond, crystallizes as, consequence of reduction of carbon)

CO2 = C + O2	[1]

CH4 + O2 = C + 2H2O	[2]

As such, the speciation of carbon and the formation of diamond will be intimately associated with the oxidation state of mantle rocks, which is likely controlled by Fe0-Fe2+-Fe3+ components in silicate minerals, metals, and melts (e.g.,  2011;  ).
(speciation of carbon, will be associated with, oxidation state of mantle rocks)
(formation of diamond, will be associated with, oxidation state of mantle rocks)

A synthesis of diamond formation includes a modern view of mantle oxidation state, carbon speciation in peridotitic and eclogitic mantle rocks, diamond growth within a framework provided by experimental and thermodynamic observations, as well as by the stable isotopic compositions of diamonds.
(synthesis of diamond formation, includes, view of mantle oxidation state)

Discussion is arranged separately for lithospheric versus sub-lithospheric diamonds because of their different and unique nature.

Experimental and thermodynamic constraints of growth in the lithospheric mantle

Oxygen fugacity in the cratonic mantle.

The majority of diamonds sampled at the surface originated in cratonic lithosphere at depths less than 250 km and so the prevailing oxygen fugacity in cratonic mantle peridotite is important to consider.
(majority of diamonds, sampled at, surface)

At the pressures of diamond stability, garnet is stable in peridotite.
(garnet, is stable in, peridotite)

The oxygen fugacity at which garnet peridotite xenoliths from cratonic mantle equilibrated can be determined using the oxy-thermobarometer calibrated by  that employs the equilibrium,
(oxygen fugacity, employs, equilibrium)

GOO	2Fe3Fe23+Si3O12 = 4Fe2SiO4  +  2FeSiO3 + O2	[3]

garnet	olivine	opx

(see also ).

Figures 6a and 6c show fO2 determinations made using this oxy-thermobarometer for garnet-bearing xenoliths from the Kaapvaal craton (see also ) from equilibration pressures and temperatures corresponding to the diamond stability field, determined from further thermometry and barometry equilibria .

We note here that the oxy-thermobarometer of  has not been tested experimentally at pressures above 3 GPa, so some unquantified uncertainty exists in garnet peridotite oxygen fugacity estimates due to extrapolation of thermodynamic data beyond the tested range.
(uncertainty, exists in, garnet peridotite oxygen fugacity estimates)

In Figure 6a and 6c oxygen fugacity is reported relative to the fayalite-magnetite-quartz buffer reaction,

FMQ	3Fe2SiO4 + O2 = 2Fe3O4 + 3SiO2	[4]

fayalite	magnetite	quartz

i.e., Δlog fO2 (FMQ), which removes some of the temperature and pressure dependence inherent in all fO2 dependent equilibria (e.g., ).

The majority of xenolith samples plot in the range between   -2.5 and -4.5 Δlog fO2 (FMQ).

There is a slight fO2 pressure dependence to the xenolith samples, which mainly arises from the volume change of equilibrium [3] that has the tendency to drive the determined oxygen fugacities to lower levels at high pressures (e.g., ).

Consequently, some of the highest-pressure xenolith samples shown in Figure 1c, which record the lowest oxygen fugacities, are relatively fertile peridotites with garnet Fe3+/ΣFe ratios that are among the highest for these samples.

Many xenolith samples in fact record oxygen fugacities close to the Fe-Ni precipitation curve.

This curve marks the fO2 where Ni-rich Fe alloy will start to precipitate out of mantle silicates as a consequence of reduction of iron oxide, which can be calculated following procedures described in .
(curve, marks, fO2)
(Fe alloy, will start to precipitate out, of)

The curve has an fO2 close to the iron-wüstite buffer (IW),
(curve, has, fO2 close to buffer)

IW	2Fe + O2 = 2FeO	[5]

iron	wüstite

and marks an effective lower bound in mantle fO2 because significant amounts of FeO would be required to reduce from the silicates before the fO2 could pass substantially below this curve.
(amounts of FeO, would be required to reduce from, silicates)

The important point here is that at pressures where diamond is stable, cratonic lithosphere is likely to have a prevailing fO2 that is reducing enough that carbon can exist as diamond.
(lithosphere, is likely to have, fO2)
(carbon, can exist as, diamond)

Carbon speciation in peridotite.

The highest oxygen fugacity at which diamond could form within carbonated peridotite assemblages can be described in simplified terms by the reaction,
(diamond, could form within, peridotite assemblages)
(oxygen fugacity, can be described in, terms)

EMOD	MgSiO3 + MgCO3 = Mg2SiO4 + C + O2	[6]

enstatite	magnesite	olivine	diamond

which is referred to by the mineral acronym EMOD .

The fO2 buffered by this equilibria is shown in Figures 6a and 6c.

Curves plotted in Figure 6c are calculated along the average geothermal gradient for the Archean lithosphere recorded by the xenolith samples, and EMOD falls between -2 and -0.5 Δlog fO2 (FMQ).
(Curves, plotted in, Figure 6c)
(Curves, falls between, Dlog fO2)
(EMOD, falls between, Dlog fO2)

At oxygen fugacities above EMOD diamonds are unstable in peridotite rocks with respect to magnesite, and below EMOD carbonate minerals are unstable.

As shown, the vast majority of mantle xenoliths plot firmly in the diamond stability field with respect to EMOD.

The EMOD buffer can be calculated using thermodynamic data as in Figure 6  and recent experiments that have measured the fO2 of this buffer using independent redox sensitive equilibria are reasonably consistent with such calculations .
(EMOD buffer, can be calculated using, data)

measured the fO2 of the equilibrium between diamond and carbonate melt for a peridotite assemblage as a function of pressure and temperature.

The fO2 of this diamond and CO2-bearing melt equilibria was found to evolve to lower values compared to the extrapolated EMOD buffer as temperatures increase, as shown in Figure 6a.

This lowering of the fO2 arises not only from the difference in thermodynamic properties between the mineral and melt phases, but also results from the dilution of the carbonate melt by silicate components at high temperature.
(dilution of carbonate, melt by, silicate components)

Experiments confirm that the dilution of the carbonate melt component by solutes other than silicates can also drive the fO2 of the diamond melt equilibria to lower levels .
(dilution of carbonate, melt, component)

H2O is likely important in this role, as can be seen from the following calculations of C-O-H fluid speciation, but other solutes such as brines and phosphates would also act in a similar way.
(solutes, would act in, way)

Figure 6b shows the speciation of a C-O-H fluid calculated at 5 GPa and 1200 °C as a function of fO2, assuming an ideal mixing model .

This speciation calculation considers only the fluid phase and ignores the potential reaction of fluid species with silicate minerals to produce carbonates or volatile-rich melts for example.
(speciation calculation, considers, fluid phase)
(speciation calculation, ignores, reaction of fluid species with silicate minerals to produce carbonates)

However, it provides a framework to examine likely volatile speciation as a function of fO2, even if the predicted volatile species would in reality be components in other phases.
(species, be, components in phases)

At oxygen fugacities compatible with the grey region in Figure 6b, diamond is unstable with respect to CO2 fluid.
(diamond, is unstable with, respect to CO2 fluid)

Diamond can only form below the fO2 defined by the DCO (Diamond-Carbon-Oxygen) buffer equilibrium,
(Diamond, can form below, fO2 defined by DCO buffer equilibrium)

DCO	C + O2 = CO2 	[7]

The DCO buffer, as shown in Figure 6b, is generally above but within 1 log unit of EMOD at lithosphere conditions.

At oxygen fugacities below the DCO buffer diamond remains stable but the equilibrium C-O-H fluid phase evolves to become more H2O-rich.

At approximately 2 log units below DCO the so-called “water maximum” occurs, where almost pure H2O fluid is in equilibrium with diamond.
(H2O fluid, is in, equilibrium with diamond)

At oxygen fugacities below the water maximum, concentrations of CH4 in the fluid phase, and to a lesser extent H2, start to increase.

As shown in Figure 6a by the grey vertical melting curves, carbonate melts are likely to form at temperatures in the region of 1200 °C, but pure carbonates are incompatible with the fO2 of mantle xenoliths as described above.
(carbonates, are incompatible with, fO2 of mantle xenoliths)

As also shown in Figure 6a, the H2O-CO2 peridotite solidus is depressed to low temperatures  but H2O-rich carbonate melts are also unlikely to be stable at the fO2 recorded by most xenoliths.
(peridotite solidus, is depressed to, temperatures)

The majority of samples in fact record oxygen fugacities compatible with the existence of H2O-CH4 fluids, which are likely to form fluids rather than melts in the mantle due to the smaller melting point depression associated with these species .

In a recent experimental study where the fluid in quenched experimental samples was analyzed using gas chromatography to quantify fluid speciation, however, much higher concentrations of H2 compared to CH4 were identified in reduced gas mixtures produced at 6.3 GPa and 1400-1600 °C .
(gas mixtures, produced at, GPa)
(fluid in samples, was analyzed using, gas chromatography)

The majority of peridotite samples record an fO2 consistent with the stability of H2O-CH4 fluids if the calculations are informative (Fig. 6), or possibly H2O-H2 fluids if the experiments are a better guide.
(majority of samples, record, fO2)
(experiments, are, guide)

In either case, these results do not mean that diamonds necessarily formed from such fluids.
(results, do not mean that, diamonds formed from fluids)

Instead, diamond crystallization can occur as a consequence of redox gradients that exist when metasomatic melts or fluids infiltrate mantle peridotite.
(diamond crystallization, can occur as, consequence of redox gradients)
(fluids, infiltrate, mantle peridotite)

Fluids that are either more oxidizing or more reducing than the fluid that would be stable at the oxygen fugacity of mantle peridotite would be expected to crystallize diamond.
(Fluids, would be expected to crystallize, diamond)

For example, oxidized carbonate-rich melts or high-density fluids could crystallize diamond by reduction of CO2 component (as in reaction [1]), whereas diamond growth from reducing fluids could occur by oxidation of CH4 (e.g., reaction [2]).
(fluids, could crystallize, diamond)
(diamond growth from reducing fluids, could occur by, oxidation of CH4)

In these cases oxygen is absorbed or supplied by local re-adjustment of Fe2+-Fe3+ equilibria in mantle minerals.

Evidence for such reactions were reported by  who noted significant zonation in the Fe3+/ΣFe ratios determined for garnets in mantle xenoliths from the Wesselton kimberlite, consistent with the passage of liquids that have metasomatized and oxidized only the outer rim of garnet grains.
(Evidence for reactions, were reported by, noted zonation in Fe3)

Carbon speciation in eclogite.

A large proportion of cratonic diamonds and diamond inclusions are associated with eclogitic rocks and minerals.
(proportion of diamonds, are associated with, rocks)

Currently, however, there is no calibrated oxythermobarometer that can be used to determine the fO2 of eclogitic rocks.

performed experiments on model carbonated eclogite and concluded that the equilibrium,
(experiments on model, carbonated, eclogite)
(experiments on model, concluded that, equilibrium)

DCDD	CaMg(CO3)2 + 2SiO2  =  CaMgSi2O6 + 2C +  2O2	[9]

dolomite	coesite	diopside	diamond

which has the mineral acronym DCDD, would control the stability of carbonate minerals and diamond in eclogitic rocks (see also ).

As shown in Figure 6, DCDD is approximately 1 log unit above EMOD, implying that the diamond stability field is larger with respect to fO2 in eclogitic rocks.
(DCDD, is, log unit above EMOD implying)
(diamond stability field, is larger with, respect to fO2 in rocks)

The larger stability field would imply that carbonate-bearing melts or fluids stable within peridotite rocks could be reduced to diamond on entering eclogites, even if the fO2 remained essentially constant.

This change in controlling equibria may be a factor in the close association between diamonds and eclogitic xenoliths, and the prevalence of eclogitic inclusions in certain suites of lithospheric diamonds.
(change in controlling equibria, be, factor in association between diamonds)

Diamond formation in the lithospheric mantle (experimental results).

The oxygen fugacity structure of the lithospheric mantle discussed above indicates that diamond is the likely form of carbon within deep lithospheric mantle.
(diamond, is, form of carbon)

Fluids and melts have long been favored as potential growth media for diamonds, but it is a challenge to deduce the exact conditions of growth from diamonds themselves due to their elemental purity.
(Fluids, have been favored as, growth media for diamonds)
(melts, have been favored as, growth media for diamonds)

However, mineral and fluid inclusions, trace impurity chemistry (e.g., N, H, and other trace elements) and growth morphology, can provide important information for interpreting growth history.

Diamond nucleation and growth experiments have a long and glorious history, having been motivated by the importance of diamonds in both industry and academia, and provide an important context for observations from natural diamonds .

A brief synopsis of relevant experiments will contribute to understanding diamond growth in the mantle.
(synopsis of experiments, will contribute to, understanding diamond growth in mantle)

Diamond synthesis directly from C-O or C-O-H fluids has been studied experimentally at pressures generally appropriate for the lithosphere (e.g., ~5–8 GPa), although experimental temperatures tend to be higher than lithospheric because of the chemically simple systems.
(temperatures, tend to higher than, lithospheric)

In general, results show that diamonds can grow from a wide range of fluid compositions at oxygen fugacities at or below the DCO buffer (  2001;    2009;  ).
(diamonds, can grow from, range of fluid compositions at oxygen fugacities)

These studies attest to the fecundity of CO2-rich fluids, CO2-H2O fluids, graphite-H2O fluid, and CH4-rich fluids as media for nucleation and growth of diamond.
(studies, attest to, fecundity of fluids fluids fluid fluids as media for nucleation)

Nucleation and growth is apparently enhanced in H2O-rich fluids but inhibited in H2-rich fluids .
(Nucleation, is enhanced in, fluids)
(growth, is enhanced in, fluids)

Diamond growth can occur directly by reduction of carbonate components in minerals and melts, and numerous experiments show that carbonated fluids and melts provide productive diamond-forming media (e.g.,    2001a, 2004;   ).
(fluids, provide, media)
(melts, provide, media)

For example, at 7.7 GPa diamonds can form readily either from molten Ca- and Mg-carbonate  or from solid carbonate in equilibrium with a reduced, CH4-H2O fluid .

Experiments also indicate enhanced diamond growth from dolomitic melts in the presence of fluids enriched in H2O and CO2 , although  found that CO2-rich ferrous carbonate-silicate melt can be an effective waterless medium for diamond crystallization at 6.3 GPa.
(diamond growth from dolomitic, melts in, presence of fluids enriched in H2O)

The addition of alkalies to carbonate-rich fluids and melts also yields fertile diamond growth media ( 1998a, 1998b; ).
(addition of alkalies, yields, diamond growth media)
(melts, yields, diamond growth media)

Although experiments in simplified C-O-H fluid and carbonated systems are essential and insightful, fluids and melts in the lithospheric mantle will react with silicate minerals in peridotite or eclogite, which can lead to a wide range of chemically diverse compositions as seen, for example, in fibrous diamonds.
(fluids, will react with, silicate minerals in peridotite)
(melts, will react with, silicate minerals in peridotite)

Experimental data show that an array of complex fluid and melt compositions involving C-O-H fluids, carbonates, chlorides, and silicates, reminiscent of those trapped in natural diamonds, can provide suitable diamond growth media.
(data, show that, array of fluid)
(silicates, can provide, diamond growth media)

Pal’yanov et al (2002, 2005) show that reaction of carbonated fluids or melts with silicates can lead to diamond nucleation and growth.
(reaction of fluids, can lead to, diamond nucleation)

discusses how in the system Na2O–K2O–MgO–CaO–Al2O3–SiO2–C at 8.5 GPa that, as silicate components dissolve into melts, a concentration exists beyond which diamond nucleation and growth is inhibited.

According to experiments from model peridotitic-carbonate systems, the barrier may occur at ~30% dissolved silicate , whereas in model eclogitic-carbonate a value closer to 50% dissolved silicate is indicated .
(barrier, may occur at, %)

As in simple systems, H2O apparently enhances diamond crystallization in more complex alkali-chloride-carbonate-silicate-water systems.

Diamonds can grow readily in volatile-rich kimberlitic magma , and a number of studies have verified diamond nucleation and growth in a range of alkali- and chloride-rich C-bearing systems (  2011; ).
(Diamonds, have verified, diamond nucleation growth)
(number of studies, have verified, diamond nucleation growth)

A common theme amongst these studies is the importance of fluid/melt composition in facilitating or inhibiting diamond nucleation and in determining growth mechanism and crystal form.
(theme amongst studies, is, importance of fluid/melt composition)

Sulfide inclusions, such as pyrrhotite, are common amongst inclusions in lithospheric diamonds.
(Sulfide inclusions, are common amongst, inclusions in diamonds)

identified the potential importance of sulfide melts, possibly immiscible with a volatile-rich silicate melt, in the nucleation and growth of diamond.

Simple system experiments verified that carbon-saturated sulfide melts nucleate and crystallize cubo-octahedral diamond ( 2006, 2009; ), even if low carbon solubility indicates a limited role for sulfide as an agent of C dissolution and transport.
(sulfide, melts, nucleate)

(carbon solubility, indicates, role for sulfide)

suggest that FeS melt may dissolve sufficient oxygen such that carbonate in a coexisting melt could be reduced by a reaction such as:
(melt, could be reduced by, reaction)

MgCO3 + MgSiO3 = Mg2SiO4 + C + O2	[10]

where the oxygen is dissolved in the Fe-S-O melt.

Whereas  showed that when a carbonate component is involved, the role of sulfur may increase due to its important role as a reducing agent, as in the simplified reaction:

2FeS + CO2 = 2FeO + S2 + C	[11]

where CO2 would be a component in a fluid or melt.

showed that at 6 GPa sulfide–carbonic melts are highly efficient diamond-forming media, and that formation of diamond polycrystals, reminiscent of natural diamondite and carbonado, can occur from highly C-oversaturated sulfide melts.
(formation of diamond polycrystals, can occur from, sulfide)

In experiments in silicate-carbonate-sulfide systems, immiscible carbonate-silicate and sulfide melts form, and diamonds can nucleate and grow from either media , although again the overall low solubility of C in sulfide would make it a less efficient diamond producer than coexisting carbonate.
(diamonds, grow from, media)
(solubility of C, would make producer than, carbonate)

Although rare, metallic iron, sometimes accompanied by wüstite, has been reported as inclusions in natural diamonds (e.g.,  2010; ).
(iron accompanied by wustite, has been reported as, inclusions in diamonds)

Molten transition metals (e.g., Fe, Ni, Co) have long been noted for their utility as solvents for diamond growth .
(Fe, have been noted for, utility as solvents for diamond growth)

Given that the oxygen fugacity of the mantle may reach the metal saturation curve as described above, the potential for Fe-rich metallic melts as diamond-forming agents in the mantle is clear.
(oxygen fugacity of mantle, may reach, metal saturation curve)

studied diamond crystallization from Fe-Ni-C melts and found diamond nucleation and growth at P-T conditions appropriate for the lithosphere.
(studied, found, diamond nucleation growth)

These authors found that either iron (iron-nickel) or wüstite can crystallize together with diamond, depending on the redox conditions, and that iron-carbon melts are stable over a range of fO2 ranging from the stability field of iron to that of wüstite.
(iron, melts, stable over range of fO2 ranging from stability field of iron)
(wustite, melts, stable over range of fO2 ranging from stability field of iron)

produced diamonds in experiments by reaction between carbonates and highly reducing Si-bearing iron metal phases.

Thus, it is clear that metallic melts are excellent catalytic solvents for diamond growth, and if they occur in the mantle could be agents of diamond formation.

What is not clear is why metallic iron inclusions would precipitate from liquids in equilibrium with diamond.
(iron inclusions, would precipitate from, liquids)

According to calculated and experimental phase relations in the Fe-C system, there is no stability field for diamond + Fe metal, as the intermediate carbide phases Fe3C and Fe7C3 are stable throughout the pressure-temperature range of diamond stability in the mantle .
(no stability field for diamond, are stable throughout, range of diamond stability)

A number of studies have proposed that in a vertically isochemical mantle the oxygen fugacity will decrease with increasing pressure as a result of the stabilization of Fe2O3 over FeO components in modally abundant mantle minerals .
(oxygen fugacity, will decrease with, pressure as result of stabilization of Fe2O3)

Experiments that support this stabilization demonstrate high Fe3+/∑Fe ratios in mineral phases from the deep upper mantle, transition zone and lower mantle, even when these minerals are equilibrated with iron metal.
for example, showed that at pressures above 10 GPa majoritic garnet contains over 20% of total Fe in the Fe3+ state in equilibrium with Fe metal.

Wadsleyite, the main mineral in the transition zone, has been shown to contain about 2% Fe3+ at the same fO2 .
(Wadsleyite, has been shown to contain, %)

As can be seen in Figure 6a, many of the deepest lithospheric samples are not far displaced from the Fe-Ni precipitation curve where equilibrium with metal would start to occur.

Therefore the fO2 of the base of the upper mantle and transition zone are likely to be on average close to the IW oxygen buffer.

for example, estimate that for an upper mantle Fe/O content, mantle oxygen fugacity would decrease with depth such that an FeNi-metal alloy would precipitate beginning at depths of about 250 km.

Estimates for the bulk Fe3+/∑Fe ratio of the upper mantle are less than 2% .
In the transition zone where the dominant minerals are wadsleyite and majoritic garnet, the upper mantle Fe3+ content would be below that required for these minerals to be in equilibrium with Fe metal.
(minerals, are, wadsleyite)

Thus, for a mantle with constant Fe/O, the implication is that another source must produce the additional Fe3+ required for these iron-bearing minerals to be in equilibrium with iron metal .
(source, must produce, Fe3)

The additional source of Fe3+ is predicted to be disproportionation of FeO in mineral phases through the reaction:

3FeO = Fe2O3 + Fe	[12]

In the lower mantle the modally predominant mineral is aluminous silicate perovskite, which has an Fe3+/∑Fe content of over 50% when coexisting with metallic Fe .
As in the case of the transition zone, if whole mantle convection occurs and the total oxygen content of the upper mantle is similar to the lower mantle (e.g., constant Fe/O), then metallic Fe-Ni alloy must precipitate in the lower mantle to provide sufficient Fe3+ for perovskite .
(alloy, must precipitate in, mantle)

The fO2 of the lower mantle is therefore also likely to be at or below IW and anomalously large concentrations of Fe2O3 would have to arise from somewhere to raise the fO2 above IW.

Thus, the deep upper mantle and the entirety of the transition zone and lower mantle are expected to be reducing and metal-saturated.

Carbon speciation in the sub-lithospheric mantle.

Several recent experimental studies have indicated that the fO2 of buffering reactions between diamond and magnesite, which are analogs to EMOD in the transition zone and lower mantle rocks, are at approximately the same oxygen fugacity relative to IW as EMOD in the upper mantle .

For example, the reaction,

MgO + C + O2= MgCO3	[13]

is the analog buffering reaction to EMOD throughout the lower mantle and lies between two and three log units above IW.
(analog, lies between, log units above IW)

Therefore, given no large perturbation in the bulk oxygen content, the deeper mantle should be in the diamond stability field.
(mantle, should be in, diamond stability field)

On the basis of calculations of carbon speciation in the C-O-H system like those shown in Figure 6, the deep upper mantle, transition zone, and possibly the uppermost lower mantle could be in equilibrium with a CH4-H2O fluid, whereas in the deeper lower mantle equilibrium fluids may become H2O-dominated .
(uppermost, could be in, equilibrium with fluid)
(mantle, could be in, equilibrium with fluid)

We stress again that such a fluid is calculated without consideration of equilibrium with silicate minerals, and with gross extrapolation of thermodynamic data.
(fluid, is calculated without, consideration of equilibrium with silicate minerals)

Experiments and first-principles calculations are needed to identify and quantify carbon species in more realistic deep mantle fluids and melts .
(Experiments calculations, are needed to identify, carbon species)

Diamond formation in the sub-lithospheric mantle.

As described in the preceding sections, over much of its depth range, sub-lithospheric mantle is metal-saturated.

If a free fluid phase were present in this reducing primitive mantle peridotite, calculations suggest it will be CH4 and H2O-rich.
(fluid phase, were present in, this reducing mantle peridotite)

However, given the high-storage capacity of the deep upper mantle and transition zone for hydrogen (e.g., ), a free fluid phase likely is not present, and carbon may be locked up in solid Fe(Ni) carbides and diamond.

Given the low estimates for the C content of the primitive mantle (~50 to 200 ppm), carbides such as Fe3C and Fe7C3 that are stable along a mantle adiabat  can accommodate the entire primitive mantle carbon budget.
(carbides, can accommodate, mantle carbon budget)

Thus, in ambient primitive sub-lithospheric mantle, diamond may not be present.

We expect that, in general, sub-lithospheric diamonds likely formed by metasomatic processes involving reducing ambient mantle with C-bearing fluids or melts.

In common with the lithospheric mantle, diamond crystallization may occur predominantly as a result of redox equilibria between a metasomatic melt and solid mantle phases.

Mineral inclusions in sub-lithospheric diamonds, such as majorite, Ca-rich perovskite, and Mg-rich perovskite, provide evidence for diamond formation at depths throughout the deep upper mantle, transition, and the upper part of the lower mantle (see  ).
(inclusions in diamonds, provide, evidence for diamond formation at depths)

An important goal of future research will be to link sub-lithospheric inclusion mineralogy and trace element composition to diamond fluid composition, deep mantle melt migration, and mantle redox in a way that can be related to mantle convection patterns (e.g., ).
(goal of research, will be to link, inclusion mineralogy trace element composition)
(mantle, melt, migration)

Stable isotopic compositions

C-isotopes of diamonds.

More than four thousand carbon isotopic compositions on diamonds are available, including representative data from worldwide diamond mines including Siberia; Canada; Australia; Brazil; and West, East, and southern Africa (Botswana and South Africa), as well as diamonds formed in other usually less constrained contexts.

Historically, these data stem from the combustion analyses of diamonds (e.g.,    ) but these bulk analyses are being rapidly augmented by somewhat less precise, in-situ analyses made by SIMS (e.g., ).
(data, stem from, combustion analyses of diamonds)
(bulk analyses, are being augmented by, less analyses made by SIMS)

The distribution of δ13C-values of diamonds formed in Earth’s mantle (Fig. 7) are usually divided into distinct diamond populations on the basis of several factors: (1) their eclogitic versus peridotitic paragenesis as inferred from their inclusions, (2) their relative crystallization ages as inferred by younger, often kimberlite-age fibrous coats of coated diamonds grown upon older, typically Archean and Proterozoic monocrystalline diamond cores, (3) their depth of origin in the lithosphere, transition zone or lower mantle as inferred from their inclusions, and (4) their morphology as monocrystalline versus polycrystalline aggregates (including boart, framesites), the latter whose formation age might be closely related to the kimberlite eruption age (e.g., ).
(formation age, might be related to, eruption age)
(distribution, are divided into, diamond populations)

In addition, δ13C values have been measured on (5) polycrystalline, sintered diamonds known as carbonado , whose extra-terrestrial, mantle or crustal origin is unclear (see  and references therein), and (6) microdiamonds (typically < 500 microns) formed in crustal rocks subducted to pressures greater than 3.5 GPa along a cold, crustal geotherm.
(d13C values, have been measured on, 5)

These latter two groups are considered petrogenetically distinct and will be discussed separately.

Figure 7 is a summary diagram of the worldwide data set for the C isotopic composition of diamond.
(Figure, is, summary diagram of data set for C composition of diamond)

Several key points are clear from the distributions seen:
(points, are clear from, distributions seen)

• Worldwide samples cover a large carbon isotopic composition (δ13C) ranging from –41 to +5‰, a range close to that displayed by sedimentary rocks.
(* Worldwide samples, cover, carbon composition ranging from +5)

• Approximately 72% are contained within a narrower interval of –8 to –2‰, centered on a value approximately –5 ± 1‰.

This range is similar to the range displayed by other mantle-derived rocks such as mid-ocean ridge basalts, ocean island basalts, carbonatites, kimberlites.
(range, is similar to, range displayed by rocks)

• The distribution is continuous with a clear decrease in frequency on either side of a δ13C-value of about –5‰.
(* distribution, is continuous with, decrease in frequency)

• The δ13C-distributions are significantly different between their respective growth environments.

Peridotitic diamonds cover a narrower range of δ13C-values (from –26.4 to +0.2 ‰), than eclogitic diamonds (from –41.3 to +2.7‰), whilst both coated and lower mantle peridotitic diamonds show narrow ranges of values (–8.1 to –4.9‰) and (–8.5 to –0.5‰), respectively.
(diamonds, cover, range)

• Deep (from transition zone and lower mantle) eclogitic diamonds have variable abundances of negative or positive δ13C-values, (here defined as being below –10‰)
(* diamonds, have, abundances)

• Diamond formed in metamorphic rocks subducted at ultra-high pressures have δ13C-values ranging from –30 to –3‰, whereas carbonados are mostly from –32 to –25 ‰ and up to -5‰.
(* Diamond, formed in, rocks subducted at pressures)

Individual mines commonly display δ13C-distributions similar to those illustrated by the worldwide distributions in that their peridotitic diamonds have the typical uni-modal, mantle-like C isotopic distribution and their eclogitic diamonds despite showing nearly the same mode show a strong negative skewness (Fig. 7).

However there are several striking exceptions where unique uni-modal eclogitic compositions centered outside the typical mantle-like C values occur: δ13C of –35‰ for the Jericho kimberlitic diamonds, Slave craton Canada (Fig. 7; De  ); δ13C of      –27‰ for the Dachine lamprophyric or komatiitic diamonds, French Guyana (Fig. 7;  ); δ13C of –15‰ for the Guaniamo kimberlitic diamonds, Venezuela , δ13C of –11‰ for the Argyle lamproitic diamonds, western Australia  and δ13C of +2‰ for placer diamonds from New South Wales, eastern Australia .

Rare peridotitic diamonds analyzed so far from these sources show typical mantle δ13C-values of around –5‰.

Other localities such as Orapa, Botswana and Jagersfontain, South Africa ( 1993) show a strong bimodal δ13C-distribution with a first peak at about –5‰ and a second at about –20‰ in both peridotitic and eclogitic diamonds.

The important question of whether these carbon isotopic compositions are primordial, reflect mantle carbon, or are evidence for subducted carbon depends on the how C isotopic compositions fractionate and evolve in mantle fluids as they migrate through the mantle and diamonds crystallize.
(mantle carbon, depends on, the)
(evidence for carbon, depends on, the)

Diamond C-isotopic variability, speciation of carbon, and carbon sources.

In-situ analyses of single diamonds usually display a limited range ~3‰, which is more isotopically homogeneous in C-isotope composition than the range of all diamonds from the same mine.
(analyses of diamonds, display, range ~ %0)

The trends in C-isotope composition with other tracers, such as N-content and N-isotopic composition, recorded either within a single diamond or within a diamond population, can help in elucidating the speciation (oxidized versus reduced) of carbon in the fluid/melt associated with diamond precipitation .
(trends in composition with tracers recorded, can help in, elucidating speciation)

Carbon isotopic composition is sensitive to fO2 because the reduced carbon in a diamond is depleted in 13C, at isotope equilibrium, by 2-3‰ at T ~1000 °C compared to oxidized carbon (CO2, carbonate).
(Carbon composition, is sensitive to, fO2)
(carbon in diamond, is depleted in, 13C)

In comparison, diamond in equilibrium with a more reduced form of carbon such as methane is enriched in 13C by about 1‰.
(diamond in equilibrium, is enriched in, 13C)

The exact magnitude of isotope fractionation between diamond and coexisting fluid relies on theoretical calculations and experimental data (e.g.,   ), whose constraints on isotopic exchange are limited, at present, in temperature, pressure, and composition.
(magnitude of isotope fractionation between diamond, relies on, calculations)

Even with these uncertainties, there is no doubt that isotopic fractionation occurs as diamonds grow from fluids (see discussion in  ) and must be considered in addition to C isotopic differences inherited from C sources.
(no doubt, must be considered in, addition to C differences inherited from C sources)
(fractionation, occurs, that)
(diamonds, grow from, fluids)

Diamonds can form from reduced (methane; equation [2]) or oxidized (CO2, carbonate; equations [1,9,10,11,12]) carbon (e.g., ).
(Diamonds, can form from, reduced)

A diamond or a diamond population displaying a histogram of δ13C-distribution with negative skewness from the mean mantle value and a linear relationship between δ13C and logarithmic values of diamond N-contents has been suggested to be formed from methane (Fig. 8;  ).
(diamond displaying histogram, has been suggested to be formed from, methane)
(diamond population, has been suggested to be formed from, methane)

The occurrence of CO2 inclusions  particularly in some eclogitic diamonds , the occurrence of metasomatic inclusions , positive skewness of some peridotitic δ13C distributions , and δ13C-N relationships in core-rim traverses of individual diamonds  provide evidence for diamond precipitation from oxidized carbon.
(occurrence of CO2 inclusions, provide, evidence for diamond precipitation from carbon)

Further evidence for formation from oxidized carbon is found in the fibrous coats of coated diamonds, which trap mantle fluids bearing carbonate nano-inclusions ( see also  and references therein).
(evidence for formation from carbon, is found in, coats of diamonds)

Even though fibrous diamonds often are homogeneous (typically 3‰; ) they can also document, sometimes within single growth zones, a consistent increase of 3‰ in δ13C-range starting from a value near –8 up to –5‰ (e.g.,   and references therein).

These observations are again consistent with precipitation from oxidized carbon.
(observations, are consistent with, precipitation from carbon)

It is worth noting, however, that in most cases, and especially for sub-lithospheric diamonds, this direct inference cannot be made.

In this case, additional tracers are needed to better characterize the proportion of diamond precipitating from reduced/oxidized carbon.
(tracers, are needed to, better)

Diamond crystallization alone from its source melt/fluid seems unlikely to account for the largest range in δ13C values of diamonds, because otherwise eclogitic and peridotitic diamonds would display similar distributions.
(Diamond crystallization, seems to account, unlikely)
(diamonds, would display, distributions)

This fundamental observation is the basis for suggesting that diamond growth can be a recorder of mantle δ13C-variability  by being inherited from various mantle sources.
(observation, is, basis for suggesting)
(diamond growth, be, recorder)

There are two schools of thought.

Following the early suggestion of  that diamond would record primordial isotope heterogeneity, the occurrence of primordial carbon has been suggested for a few diamonds from Kankan, that have a δ13C value close to –3.5‰ (i.e., being neither isotopically heterogeneous nor depleted in the 13C-isotope; ).
(diamond, would record, isotope heterogeneity)
(occurrence of carbon, has been suggested for, diamonds from Kankan)

While the existence of primordial mantle carbon reservoirs can explain the general range of diamond δ13C (e.g., ), it still fails to account for the distinct δ13C-distributions among the general population of eclogitic and peridotitic diamonds.
(existence of mantle carbon reservoirs, can explain, range of diamond d13C)

The alternative, non-exclusive interpretation is that mantle δ13C-variability recorded in diamonds (i.e., primarily eclogitic) reflects the persistence of isotope variability resulting from the subduction of sedimentary carbon (e.g., ).

The basaltic crust of the oceanic lithosphere contains considerable organic carbon, all of which is isotopically light (low) in its δ13C composition.
(crust of lithosphere, contains, carbon)

The oceanic lithosphere also is hydrothermally altered and takes on anomalous compositions in δ18O.
(lithosphere, takes, compositions in d18O)

Subduction of this material and its conversion to eclogite, a common and ongoing geological process, can account for both the anomalous δ13C of diamonds and δ18O of eclogite xenoliths in kimberlite.
(Subduction of material, can account for, d13C of diamonds)
(conversion to eclogite, can account for, d13C of diamonds)

The possibility that diamond might form from subducted carbon is usually also addressed from the study of diamond structural impurities and mineral inclusions.
(diamond, might form from, carbon)
(possibility, is addressed from, study of diamond impurities)

A contribution to the differences in eclogitic and peridotitic δ13C isotope distributions also could result from distinctly different evolution of oxidized-C-bearing fluids in eclogite versus peridotite ( 2001).
(contribution to differences in d13C isotope distributions, could result from, evolution of fluids)

Differences in evolution are due to differences in fluid H2O/CO2-ratio and the extent of decarbonation reactions in olivine-free eclogitic compositions.
(Differences in evolution, are due to, differences)

Because carbonate decarbonation is associated with 13C/12C fractionation (CO2 being 13C-enriched) this additional process can increase C-isotope variability found in eclogitic diamonds.
(process, can increase, variability found in diamonds)
(carbonate decarbonation, is associated with, 13C/12C fractionation)

Although this model is based on the previous experimental work  and finds increasing support (e.g., ), it is worth noting that it relies on a limited series of experiments.
(model, is based on, work)
(model, finds, support)

In particular, experiments involving methane are still lacking.

Future work is likely to highlight new reactions that might be relevant to better understand eclogitic diamond formation.
(work, is likely to highlight, reactions)

Nitrogen in diamonds: contents, speciation, and isotopic composition.

Interest in studying N-isotopes in diamonds originates from the original identification that mantle nitrogen is deprived in the 15N isotope compared to surface reservoirs such as the atmosphere (0‰) and the crust and its sediments, which are enriched in 15N .
(Interest in studying, originates from, identification)
(mantle nitrogen, is deprived in, that 15N isotope)

This view has since been supported by a wealth of data (Fig. 9).
(view, has been supported by, wealth of data)

Analysis of fibrous diamonds and mid-ocean ridge basalts and older mantle derived-samples such as peridotitic diamonds that show predominantly negative δ15N values.

In contrast, metasediments show enrichment in 15N-isotope (positive δ15N) both in the present and the Archean; the amount of negative δ15N values in sediments is very rare (as reviewed by ).
(metasediments, show, enrichment)

Furthermore, during sediment subduction, if any devolatilization occurs it would preferentially release 14N, leaving a further 15N-enriched subducted material  as shown by data on metamorphic diamonds ( and references therein).

Although a limited dataset is available, altered ocean crust and oceanic lithosphere also display positive δ15N .
(ocean crust, display, d15N)
(lithosphere, display, d15N)

Nitrogen in sedimentary/crustal rocks occurs as ammonium ions substituting for potassium and therefore the behavior of nitrogen in subduction zones is expected to follow the fate of potassic minerals, some of which have been experimentally demonstrated to be stable to mantle depths ( 2010).
(Nitrogen in rocks, occurs as, ammonium ions substituting for potassium)
(Nitrogen in rocks, is expected to follow, fate of minerals)
(Nitrogen in rocks, have been demonstrated to stable to, mantle depths)
(behavior of nitrogen, is expected to follow, fate of minerals)

If eclogitic diamonds form from subducted carbon and nitrogen, they would be predicted to display positive δ15N-values, as seen in subducted metamorphic rocks (i.e., values distinctly higher than a homogeneous mantle with δ15N isotopic composition near –5‰).
(diamonds, form from, carbon)

This is certainly the case for most of the deep diamonds from the mantle transition zone such as at Jagersfontein, South Africa and the Sao Luis-Juina fields, Brazil  and possibly at Dachine, French Guyana .

But many eclogitic diamonds worldwide show a δ15N-distribution similar to most peridotitic diamonds, pointing to a mantle origin of their nitrogen and therefore of their carbon (Fig. 9).

About half of eclogitic diamonds with low-δ13C values also show negative δ15N-values.

These δ13C-δ15N-N co-variations have been argued to be inconsistent with simple mixing of subduction components (see  for review) and the data thus have been interpreted to reflect decarbonation reactions occurring in eclogites.
(data, have been interpreted to reflect, reactions occurring in eclogites)

However, the remarkably low-δ15N compositions of the peridotitic diamonds from Pipe 50, China  suggests that variability in the N isotopic composition of mantle exists, and might mask the straightforward assignment of a positive δ15N to recycled components involved in diamond formation.

With a heterogeneous mantle, the δ13C-δ15N mixing relationships become more complex.
(relationships, become, complex)

Evidence for subduction is clear from many studies: sulfur isotope of sulfide inclusions, oxygen isotopes of eclogitic silicate inclusions and eclogite nodules, and geological considerations.
(Evidence for subduction, is clear from, studies)

But subduction seems to require some decoupling of carbonfrom other elements, like N. This view can be reconciled by metasomatic processes during diamond formation.
(subduction, seems to require, decoupling of carbonfrom elements)

But it remains unclear, if carbon is a massively cycled element, why the presence of low δ13C for recycled carbon in eclogitic diamonds remains rarer than the normal mantle-like δ13C.
(carbon, is, element)
(presence of d13C, remains, rarer than d13C)

Perhaps the amount of C recycled form the mantle portion of the slab which should have δ13C near -5‰ has been underestimated.

Thermobarometry

Chemical thermobarometry.

Chemical thermobarometers are expressions that allow one to retrieve the temperature (or pressure) of formation of a mineral species or mineral assemblage knowing the chemical compositions of the minerals and how these compositions are expected to vary with P (or T) of formation.
(Chemical thermobarometers, are, expressions)
(compositions, are expected to vary with, P)

In principle, thermobarometers are based on chemical equilibria between at least two mineral species, but approximate formulations can sometimes be devised that consider the composition of a single mineral, which is assumed to be in equilibrium with another phase capable to buffer its composition under certain P and T. Single-mineral thermobarometers are particularly useful for diamond studies, inasmuch as (1) most inclusions in diamonds are made of isolated mineral grains, (2) non-touching mineral grains included in the same diamond may have been incorporated at different times and P–T conditions and thus may not be in equilibrium, and (3) polymineralic inclusions made of touching mineral grains presumably had enough time to re-equilibrate at depth after diamond formation during long-standing storage in the mantle.
(that, consider, composition of mineral)
(mineral grains, included in, diamond)
(inclusions, made of, touching mineral grains had)
(thermobarometers, are based on, chemical equilibria)
(inclusions in diamonds, are made of, mineral grains)

Single-mineral thermobarometry of monomineralic inclusions will provide an indication of the P–T of formation of the diamond, provided the inclusions are syngenetic, or had time to re-equilibrate completely during diamond-forming processes, and did not undergo any transformation afterwards.
(thermobarometry of inclusions, will provide, indication)
(P, provided, inclusions)

In contrast, two-mineral thermobarometry of touching inclusions may not necessarily provide the temperature of diamond formation, although the pressure estimate will still provide an indication of the depth of provenance of the diamond.
(thermobarometry of inclusions, may not provide, temperature of diamond formation)
(pressure estimate, will provide, indication of depth of provenance of diamond)

The reader is referred to  for a review of P–T estimates for lithospheric diamonds based on single- and two-mineral thermobarometry of their inclusions.
(reader, is referred to, for)

Estimates for over one thousand stones indicate that lithospheric diamonds can form at any depth within the appropriate P–T conditions for diamond stability, with a temperature mode around 1150–1200 °C.
(diamonds, can form at, depth within P)

Rather than reflecting a favored condition for diamond formation, this mode may simply represent the most “probable” temperature range within the limits imposed by diamond stability, depth of the lithosphere and mantle adiabat under typical cratonic thermal regimes.
(mode, may represent, temperature range within limits imposed by diamond stability)

The reliability of some of the thermometers used by  and by many previous workers, particularly those based on Fe–Mg exchange reactions between garnet and orthopyroxene, clinopyroxene or olivine, and the popular two-pyroxene thermometer of  is questionable .

The accuracy of the widely used Opx–Grt barometers at P > 5 GPa and for orthopyroxenes with excess Na over Cr + Ti (i.e., about 13% of reported Opx inclusions) also remains to be explored in detail .
(Opx, remains to be explored in, detail)

In particularly unfavorable cases, errors can exceed 150–200 °C and 1.5 GPa (i.e., 45 km in estimated depth).
(errors, can exceed, 150)

Especially at a local scale and for specific inclusion populations, these errors may obscure possible heterogeneities in the vertical distribution of diamonds.
(errors, may obscure, heterogeneities)

Thermobarometry of eclogitic inclusions remains particularly problematic, because Fe–Mg exchange thermometry of Grt–Cpx pairs is affected by large uncertainties (at least ±100 °C), mostly owing to Fe3+ problems (Krogh ), and fully satisfactory, well-tested barometers are not yet available (Fig. 10).
(Thermobarometry of inclusions, remains, problematic)
(Cpx pairs, is affected by, uncertainties)

It is also worth noting that in some diamond suites non-touching inclusions apparently yield hotter conditions than touching inclusions and xenoliths from the same kimberlite (e.g.,    ) and that no relationship occurs between the non-touching inclusion temperatures and those deduced from the N-aggregation state of the diamond.
(inclusions, yield, conditions than inclusions)
(inclusions, occurs between, inclusion temperatures)
(no relationship, occurs between, inclusion temperatures)

This result suggests diamond formation during transient thermal perturbations, secular cooling of the lithosphere after diamond formation or, simply, disequilibrium.
(result, suggests, diamond formation during perturbations)

In many other cases, however, no discrepancy exists , suggesting that diamond-forming fluids were thermally equilibrated with the ambient mantle.
(fluids, were equilibrated with, mantle)

This result implies that the lithospheric mantle had already cooled to a conductive thermal regime billions of years ago when the diamonds formed and that this thermal regime was comparable to that recorded in mantle xenoliths erupted during emplacement of the much younger host kimberlite (e.g., Cretaceous in the case of the Kaapvaal and Slave cratons).
(mantle, had cooled to, regime billions of ago)
(mantle, was comparable to, erupted during emplacement of host kimberlite)
(regime, was comparable to, erupted during emplacement of host kimberlite)
(recorded in mantle xenoliths, erupted during, emplacement of host kimberlite)

The possibility that these inclusions are all protogenetic and did not re-equilibrate completely during diamond crystallization should also be considered.

In view of the above complications, in the present review particular emphasis is placed on the results of single-mineral thermobarometry on monomineralic inclusions, because they have the best potential to reflect the true P–T conditions of diamond formation.

Considering the wide range of pressures and temperatures under which diamonds may form, the potentially large influence of input P on T estimates (and vice versa), and the possible formation of diamond under perturbed or ancient thermal conditions, the most useful mineral species will be those that demonstrably allow sufficiently accurate retrieval of both P and T of formation.

At present, the choice is restricted to diopsides belonging to the ultramafic paragenesis that can be assumed to be in equilibrium with garnet and orthopyroxene and allow application of the Cr-in-Cpx barometer and enstatite-in-Cpx thermometer of Nimis and Taylor (2000; Fig. 11a).
(choice, is restricted to, diopsides belonging to paragenesis)

Thermal re-equilibration of Cpx with Grt alone (± olivine) causes negligible effects on P–T estimates; therefore Cpx + Grt ± olivine polymineralic inclusions should provide the same information as monomineralic Cpx inclusions .
(Cpx, should provide, information as Cpx inclusions)

The enstatite-in-Cpx thermometer has proved to be a very robust method .

The Cr-in-Cpx barometer has two limitations: first, tests against experiments indicated progressive underestimation at P > 4.5 GPa (up to ca.
(barometer, has, limitations)
(tests against experiments, indicated, underestimation)

–0.8 GPa at P = 7 GPa; ); second, typical analytical uncertainties may propagate large errors for Cpx with low values of aCr = Cr – 0.81·Na·Cr/(Cr + Al) (atoms per formula unit), which is the main building block in the barometer formulation.
(uncertainties, may propagate, errors)

Standard analytical conditions may result in errors exceeding 1–2 GPa for compositions with aCr < 0.005 (i.e., for about 10% of reported diopside inclusions).
(Standard conditions, may result in, errors exceeding 1)

This error accounts well for the larger overall scatter in P–T points for inclusions using single-Cpx thermobarometry compared with Opx–Grt thermobarometry (Fig. 11a).

Filtered P–T estimates confirm the mode around 1150–1200 °C, the distribution of most P–T values along typical cratonic geotherms, and the existence of a few “hot” inclusions approaching the mantle adiabat (Fig. 11a).
(P, confirm, mode around 1150)
(T estimates, confirm, mode around 1150)

Systematic shift of most websteritic diopsides to lower P may be due to T underestimation owing to absence of Opx in the original assemblage or to poor reliability of the Cr-in-Cpx barometer for very low-Cr# compositions––the barometer calibration only included diopsides with Cr# = 0.09–0.44 .
(barometer calibration, included, diopsides with Cr)

Majorite-rich garnet inclusions allow retrieval of P from the fraction of majoritic component .
(garnet inclusions, allow, retrieval of P)

Although T remains undetermined, the majorite barometer appears to be thermally and compositionally robust, thus allowing the minimum pressure of formation to be estimated.
(T, remains, undetermined)

Even allowing for generous uncertainties, the results for isolated monomineralic inclusions indicate beyond any doubt that diamonds containing majoritic garnet could form at very great depth (Fig. 11b).
(results for inclusions, indicate beyond, doubt)
(diamonds containing garnet, could form at, that depth)

Ranges of possible temperatures of formation may vary over several hundred °C, depending on the interpreted formational setting: <1200 °C for eclogitic diamonds formed in a subducting slab , about 1250–1400 °C for peridotitic diamonds formed in a deep lithosphere , >1400 °C for diamonds formed in ascending mantle plumes .
(Ranges of temperatures of formation, may vary over, deg C)

Although the abundance of diamonds with majorite-rich garnet inclusions decreases with increasing P, existing estimates indicate a more or less continuous spreading from the deep lithosphere to the deep transition zone (Fig. 11b).
(abundance of diamonds, decreases with, P)
(estimates, indicate, spreading from lithosphere)

Such distribution supports a potential genetic link between many majoritic garnet-bearing diamonds and the rare super-deep diamonds with inclusions of interpreted lower-mantle origin .
(distribution, supports, link between diamonds)

cautioned that many of the relatively low-P majoritic inclusions may originally have formed at much greater depth.

If they formed in a clinopyroxene-poor medium, the pyroxene can be consumed by dilution into the garnet with no further change in composition recorded with increasing depth.
(pyroxene, can be consumed by, dilution into garnet)

Furthermore, slow rise of the diamond during mantle upwelling may lead to subsolidus re-equilibration of the inclusion (e.g., clinopyroxene exsolution) to lower P .

Although special care is given when investigating the chemical composition of diamond inclusions, the possibility that cryptic exsolution has been overlooked in some of these inclusions should be considered.
(exsolution, has been overlooked in, some of inclusions)

Elastic methods for geobarometry of diamonds.

Elastic methods provide a potential, generally non-destructive alternative to chemical thermobarometry for the evaluation of the pressure of formation of a diamond containing a monomineralic inclusion.
(methods, provide, alternative to chemical thermobarometry)

These methods are based on the measurement of the “internal pressure” (hereafter Pi; also called “residual” or “remnant” pressure), that is the pressure exerted by the diamond on the inclusion when the diamond–inclusion pair is at room P–T.
(inclusion pair, is at, room P)
(methods, are based on, measurement of pressure)

Such pressure can be retreived by using three different techniques: (1) microRaman spectroscopy (e.g.,    ); (2) strain birefringence analysis , and (3) single-crystal X-ray diffraction .
(pressure, can be retreived by, using techniques)

Combining the Pi with data on the thermoelastic parameters (i.e., volume bulk modulus and its pressure and temperature derivatives, volume thermal expansion, shear modulus) of the diamond and of the inclusion allows one to calculate an “isomeke”, i.e., a curve in P–T space along which the volume of the inclusion is equal to the volume of the cavity within the diamond for a fixed value of Pi.
(Combining, allows to calculate, one)
(of, allows to calculate, one)
(volume of inclusion, is equal to, volume of cavity within diamond)

Such line constrains the possible conditions under which the diamond and the inclusion formed.
(line, constrains, conditions)

If T is known independently, e.g., from FTIR data, or the isomeke is not strongly dependent on T, then the P at the time of encapsulation of the inclusion can be determined.

Available estimates of the pressure of formation for coesite inclusions based on Pi data are generally much too low for diamond stability (Fig. 12).
(estimates of pressure of formation for inclusions based on Pi data, are low for, diamond stability)

On the whole, P estimates for olivine are more acceptable, but they still straddle the graphite–diamond boundary, indicating again some P underestimation at least for some samples (Fig. 12).

The limited success of elastic methods thus far indicates that either the diamonds did not behave in a solely elastic fashion or that thermoelastic data for the minerals are inaccurate (see the recent review by ).
(diamonds, did not behave in, fashion)

The potential applicability of elastic methods to inclusions of important minerals for which single-mineral chemical barometers do not exist (e.g., olivine, chromite, coesite) makes these methods worthy of further testing.
(olivine, makes, methods)

However, re-assessment of thermoelastic parameters for the minerals included in diamond using state-of-the-art techniques and equipments is necessary before these methods can be trustworthily used.

Geochemistry and age

Syngenesis or protogenesis?

Mineral inclusions can be classified as protogenetic, syngenetic, or epigenetic according to the timing of their crystallization (earlier, contemporaneous, or later) with respect to that of their diamond host .
(inclusions, can be classified as, protogenetic)

Inclusions forming along fractures or made of alteration minerals after former syn- or protogenetic inclusions can be identified as epigenetic.
(Inclusions forming along fractures, can be identified as, epigenetic)
(made of alteration minerals, can be identified as, epigenetic)

Discrimination of syngenetic and protogenetic inclusions is less straightforward.

Such distinction is important, because in the case of syngenesis any geological information extracted from the inclusion (e.g., P-T of formation, geochemical environment, age) would also unequivocally apply to its host diamond.

A protogenetic inclusion would record conditions that existed before its encapsulation but this might range from geologically short to very long timescales.
(inclusion, would record, conditions)

In the latter case a protogenetic inclusion would be unrelated to diamond formation.
(inclusion, would be unrelated to, diamond formation)

Demonstrably protogenetic inclusions would support models of diamond formation involving fluxes of C-bearing fluids through pre-existing mantle rocks and could help explain occurrences of isotopically different inclusions in the same generation of diamond (e.g., ).
(inclusions, would support, models of diamond formation involving fluxes of fluids)

In cases of protogenicity, although absolutely accurate ages of diamond formation would not be obtained from the inclusions, a maximum age would be obtained and a general age pattern of diamond growth in a region of lithospheric mantle might still be evident (see Age systematics and isotopic compositions, below).
(ages of diamond formation, would not be obtained from, inclusions)

The most commonly used proof of syngenesis is the imposition of the morphology of the diamond on the inclusion (Fig. 13; e.g.,   1972;    1987;  ).
(proof of syngenesis, is, imposition of morphology of diamond)

Compositional consistency with associated mineral inclusions is another important criterion as, for example, in the syngenetic low-Si mica inclusions that are documented in peridotite (U/P-type) and eclogitic (E-type) diamonds as phlogopite and biotite, respectively .
(consistency with mineral inclusions, is, criterion)

The recognition of several inclusions of harzburgitic garnet with diamond-imposed morphology having trace element compositions indicative of multi-stage geochemical evolution has challenged the morphology criterion .
(recognition of inclusions of garnet, has challenged, morphology criterion)

The observation that in many cases diamond growth zones, as revealed by cathodoluminescence studies, do not wrap around the inclusions is consistent with, although it does not prove, syngenesis .

An epitaxial relationship between an inclusion and its host would represent a more robust proof of syngenicity (e.g.,    Wiggers de ).
(relationship between inclusion, would represent, proof of syngenicity)

Although some apparently recurrent crystallographic orientations with potential epitaxial significance have been found for some inclusions, such orientations are rarely determined and a systematic survey for the different mineral species is lacking or has been restricted to limited sets of samples (see review in ).
(survey for mineral species, has been restricted to, sets of samples)
(orientations with significance, have been found for, inclusions)

A more recent approach to investigating diamond-inclusion relationships relies on the combination of high-resolution techniques to better understand diamond growth, especially in relation to inclusions.
(approach to investigating relationships, relies on, combination of techniques to understand diamond growth)

For example Wiggers de  applied the CL technique along with electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD), using FIB-SEM, to study the three-dimensional growth zonation around inclusions in diamond.

EBSD orientation mapping revealed that three chromite inclusions in a single diamond studied by these authors have a potential epitaxial relation with the host, within ±0.4°.
(inclusions in diamond studied by authors, have, relation with host)

One of the chromite inclusions is surrounded by a non-luminescent CL halo that has apparent crystallographic morphology with symmetrically oriented pointed features.
(One of inclusions, is surrounded by, CL halo)

The CL halo has ~200 ppm Cr and ~75 ppm Fe and is interpreted to have a secondary origin as it overprints a major primary diamond growth structure.
(CL halo, has, ppm Cr ~ ppm Fe)
(CL halo, is interpreted to have, origin)

The diamond zonation adjacent to the chromite and the morphology of the inclusion records changes in the relative growth rates and habits at the diamond-chromite interface, thus supporting a syngenetic relationship.

A resolutive approach would be one that combines accurate measurement of the crystallographic orientations of the inclusion and its host with calculations of their interfacial energies in a number of possible reciprocal orientations.

Crystallographic orientations can be determined with high accuracy and precision by in-situ, non-destructive, single-crystal X-ray diffraction on the inclusions still trapped in their diamond hosts by adapting the methods developed for high-pressure studies of single crystals in diamond-anvil cells (e.g., ).
(methods, developed for, studies of crystals)
(orientations, can be determined with, accuracy)

These methods overcome technical issues related to the accurate visual centering of the inclusions, a common difficulty in routine X-ray diffractometry, thus allowing investigation of diamonds with unfavorable morphology or with multiple inclusions.
(methods, overcome, issues related to visual centering of inclusions)

Ab-initio quantum-mechanical calculations may then show whether any particular orientation is energetically favored and should hence be expected in the case of syngenesis.

This combined methodology requires dedicated laboratories and equipment, therefore it cannot be used routinely.
(methodology, requires, laboratories equipment)

In particular, interfacial energy calculations have never been performed on inclusions in diamond.
(energy calculations, have never been performed on, inclusions in diamond)

Until a statistically significant number of crystallographic and interfacial energy data are produced, the classification of any inclusion as syngenetic based purely on morphological or crystallographic criteria should be considered with caution.
(classification of inclusion as syngenetic based, should be considered with, caution)

Inclusion type and paragenesis.

Silicate inclusions in lithospheric diamonds are commonly classified into 2 dominant parageneses—peridotitic (P-type, with harzburgitic and lherzolitic members) and eclogitic (E-type).
(Silicate inclusions in diamonds, are classified into, parageneses)

A minor websteritic paragenesis is present at some localities and a wherlitic paragenesis also can be tentatively identified ( and references therein; Fig. 14, Table 1).
(paragenesis, is present at, localities)

For garnets, this classification is clearly resolved on the basis of Cr contents, with P-type garnets having > 1 wt.% Cr2O3 (e.g.,  Fig. 14) and on the basis of Cr# (100Cr/[Cr + Al]) for clinopyroxenes where P-type clinopyroxenes (Cr-diopsides) have a Cr# of 7 to 10 .
(classification, is resolved on, basis of Cr contents)

The websteritic inclusion suite is not as clearly defined and has been used to classify silicates with transitional mineral chemistry between P- and E-type paragenesis.

For instance,  use this classification for garnets with Cr2O3 contents > 1 wt.% that have abnormally low Mg#.

have applied the websteritic classification to garnets and clinopyroxenes that have E-type chemical affinities (Cr2O3 in garnet generally <2.5%; low Cr# in clinopyroxene) that show chemical traits implying coexistence with orthopyroxene.

distinguish websteritic garnets as having relatively low Cr2O3 (<2.5%) and CaO contents of <6 wt.%.

Sodium content can be useful as  noted that E-type garnets contained elevated Na2O (>0.1%)
(garnets, contained, Na2O)

The Cr2O3 versus CaO plot for garnets (Fig. 14) has developed into a central means of classifying garnets and is a key diamond exploration tool .

In this compositional space,  first identified garnets that had not equilibrated with clinopyroxene as having low-Ca, high-Cr characteristics and designated these garnets as having come from highly-depleted harzburgitic to dunitic lithologies.

In contrast, lherzolitic garnets occupy a distinct linear trend originating from circa 2.5 wt.% Cr2O3 and 3 wt.% CaO with a slope of ~ 0.3 CaO to 1 Cr2O3 (Fig. 14).
(garnets, occupy, trend originating from circa)

defined a similar lherzolitic trend based on a line that separated 85% of diamond inclusion garnets with Cr2O3 >4 wt.%, extending upwards in Cr-Ca space with a similar slope to the Sobolev trend.

proposed more precise boundaries to the lherzolitic field, which are largely the same as the early classifications as well as more clearly defining the eclogitic and websteritic compositional fields on this plot.

likewise distinguished high-Mg and Cr chromites (Fe/(Fe + Mg) <50%; Cr2O3 >62 wt%) as characterizing diamond inclusion spinels and reflecting a harzburgite association.

Mirroring the approach to silicates, a basic subdivision of sulfides into P- and E-type chemistries, based predominately on Ni-content (Table 1) was proposed by  although  showed a clear compositional overlap and subsequent studies of sulfides for Re-Os dating have added to this continuum (e.g, ).
(studies of sulfides, have added to, continuum)

The study of mineral inclusions in sublithospheric diamonds is in a youthful stage compared to the study of inclusions in lithospheric diamonds in part due to the rarity of specimens, small grain size, and difficulties in recognizing original high-pressure minerals from their low-pressure, retrograde assemblages (e.g,, Table 2).
(study of mineral inclusions in diamonds, is in, stage)

Regardless, sublithospheric inclusions can be divided into ultramafic (peridotitic) and basaltic (eclogitic) types in a parallel manner to inclusions in lithospheric diamonds.
(inclusions, can be divided into, types)

Ultramafic types are characterized by high-pressure magnesium-rich phases such as Mg-perovskite, ringwoodite, wadsleyite, and olivine with ferro-periclase, majorite, and Ca-perovskite and their low pressure breakdown products (Table 2).
(types, are characterized by, phases)

Basaltic types are characterized by assemblages richer in basaltic components such as Ca, Al, Si, and Ti including majorite, clinopyroxene, CaTi-perovskite, Ca-perovskite, Ca-ferrite, stishovite, and the “new aluminum phase” (NAL; Table 2).
(types, are characterized by, assemblages)

Trace elements.

Pioneering work , using elevated beam currents and extended counting times, allowed the measurement of a limited number of trace elements in silicates included in diamonds.
(work using beam currents, allowed, measurement of number of trace elements in silicates included in diamonds)
(extended, allowed, measurement of number of trace elements in silicates included in diamonds)

The advent of the ion microprobe allowed the first analyses of a broad spectrum of trace elements, including the petrogenetically useful rare earth elements (REE), which indicate the extreme enrichment of incompatible elements in fluids that formed them .
(advent of ion microprobe, allowed, analyses of spectrum of trace elements)

While laser-ablation ICPMS has the potential to make the same analyses , the significantly more destructive nature of this technique has meant that trace element studies focused almost exclusively on the ion-microprobe technique (     1999, 2000, 2004;    ).
(ICPMS, has, potential)

pointed out that, from a global perspective, peridotitic garnets included in diamonds from cratonic lithosphere show a full spectrum of REE patterns from those known as sinusoidal (i.e., they have positive slopes from La to Nd or even Eu, negative slopes in the midddle REE and positive slopes again from Ho or Er to Lu; Fig. 15a), to those that are light REE depleted with flat middle REE- to heavy REE sections.
(garnets, included in, diamonds from lithosphere)

The light REE enrichment and strongly sinusoidal patterns are generally restricted to very depleted (high-Cr, low-Ca), harzburgitic major element chemistries in diamond inclusions  and garnets in diamond-bearing peridotites  and this pattern has led to the suggestion that this signature is characteristic of the imprint left on wall-rocks by the passage of diamond-forming fluids.
(REE enrichment, are restricted to, depleted)
(patterns, are restricted to, depleted)
(pattern, has led to, suggestion)
(signature, is characteristic of, imprint)

Garnets with strongly sinusoidal REE patterns often have Sr enrichments of 10 to >40 ppm  and these features, together with other characteristics, have led to the prevalent interpretation that these garnets equilibrated with C-O-H fluids (e.g., ) or carbonatitic fluids/melts  associated with diamond formation.
(Garnets with REE patterns, have, Sr enrichments of 10)
(Garnets with REE patterns, have led to, interpretation that garnets equilibrated with fluids)
(features, have led to, interpretation that garnets equilibrated with fluids)

The classic light REE depleted, typically more fertile lherzolitic garnets seem to have last equilibrated with a silicate melt.
(garnets, seem to have, equilibrated)

see the continuum between these two end-member garnet types as resulting from a spread of melt-fluid compositions generated by fractional crystallization and reaction with lithospheric wall rocks.

called such a process “percolative fractionation”.

Isotopic studies of diamond-forming fluids indicate that there are multiple fluid sources involved in diamond genesis  and hence the “C-O-H fluid” designation is likely to encompass fluids of differing types.
(fluid sources involved in diamond genesis, is likely to encompass, fluids of types)
(fluid designation, is likely to encompass, fluids of types)

The co-variation of Zr with Y in garnets can also be used to characterize the different metasomatic interactions that mantle garnets may have experienced .
(mantle garnets, may experienced, that)

When garnets included in diamonds are examined in this way ( their Fig. 22), the majority of harzburgitic garnets plot in the field for garnets that have experienced large amounts of melt depletion, with a clear trend of Zr enrichment that is usually associated with phlogopite metasomatism.
(garnets, included in, diamonds)

This trend may be reflective of one of the sources of fluids being derived from mica-rich metasomes within the lithosphere .
(trend, may be reflective of, one of sources of fluids being derived from metasomes within lithosphere)

In contrast, lherzolitic garnets range from the melt-depleted field into the regions of coupled Zr and Y enrichment that signifies silicate melt metasomatism.
(garnets, range from, field)
(silicate, melt, metasomatism)

A subset of very depleted, high-Cr garnets with either very high equilibration temperatures (Buffalo Head Hills, Alberta; ) or majoritic (high-Na) compositions  could indicate, in some locations, the possible presence of very deep (>300 km) lithospheric mantle in places, or derivation from detached slabs of basal lithosphere by kimberlites on route to the surface.

Such occurrences, while rare, offer a valuable opportunity to better understand mantle geodynamics and further study is warranted.
(occurrences, offer, opportunity to understand mantle geodynamics study)

Despite the plethora of analyses from many different cratons, the exact nature of the parental diamond melt-fluid to peridotitic diamonds remains unconstrained, because of the multiple stages of depletion and metasomatism that silicates included within diamonds have experienced.
(nature, remains, unconstrained)
(silicates, have experienced, that)

Difficulties in the geochemical interpretations include the assumption of equilibrium to calculate parental fluids/melts using trace element partitioning data and the likely lack of applicability of the partitioning data due to strong differences in distribution coefficients related to poorly constrained parental fluid compositions.
(Difficulties in interpretations, include, assumption of equilibrium to calculate fluids/melts using trace element partitioning data lack of applicability of partitioning data)

Trace element partitioning data between lherzolitic and high-Cr harzburgitic garnets over a range of C-O-H and carbonatitic fluid/melt compositions, would greatly assist our understanding of P-type diamond formation, notwithstanding the technical difficulties of such experiments.
(Trace element partitioning data between garnets, would assist, understanding of diamond formation)

E-type silicates included in diamonds show much less trace element variability that P-type silicates.
(silicates, included in, diamonds)

Eclogitic garnet inclusions have light REE depleted patterns that show broad similarities to garnets from crustal eclogites, with  light REE ~ 1 times chondritic abundances and  heavy REE ~ 30 times chondritic (Fig. 15b; e.g.,    2000, 2004).
(REE, depleted, patterns)

REE patterns for clinopyroxenes (omphacites) appear in broad equilibrium with the garnets, with  light REE enrichment and  heavy REE at ~ 1 time chondritic.
(REE patterns for clinopyroxenes, appear in, equilibrium with garnets)

noted that the major and incompatible trace element compositions of eclogitic silicates included in diamonds were more depleted than host eclogite xenoliths and interpreted these compositions as reflecting the extraction of a TTG melt during subduction of an oceanic crustal precursor that experienced eclogite facies metamorphism.
(trace element compositions of silicates, included in, diamonds)
(extraction of TTG, melt during, subduction of precursor)

The observation of positive and negative Eu anomalies in both garnet and clinopyroxene inclusions supports an origin via oceanic crustal protoliths (e.g.,  ), in agreement with the widely accepted origin of most eclogite xenoliths erupted by kimberlites through cratons (e.g.,  ).
(observation of Eu anomalies in garnet, supports, origin)

While the parentage of the E-type silicates seems straightforward with the available data, the origin of the diamonds that surround E-type silicates is not.
(parentage of silicates, seems, straightforward)

The simplest hypothesis for the origin of E-type diamonds would be via solid-state growth from a carbon-bearing crustal precursor.
(hypothesis for origin of diamonds, would be via, growth from precursor)

However, there is little evidence for the solid-state growth of most diamonds (see review in ) and increasing evidence for their metasomatic growth.

The strongest evidence for a metasomatic origin for diamonds come from studies that document extreme chemical variations across multiple inclusions in the same diamond , and relations between diamonds and host silicates in diamondiferous xenoliths revealed by microscopy  and X-ray micro-tomography .
(relations between diamonds, revealed by, microscopy)

The range in silicate inclusion equilibration temperatures indicated by diamond inclusion thermobarometry, from supra- to sub-solidus, has also been used to support a metasomatic origin for most diamonds under melt-dominated (eclogite and lherzolite) and C-O-H fluid dominated (harzburgitic) conditions .

A temporal variability has been suggested in this process, on the basis of lithospheric redox and C-isotope compositions, with Meso- to Palaeoarchean diamonds possibly forming via reduction of methane-rich fluids permeating the lithosphere, whereas in post-Archean times, reduction of carbonate-rich melts better explains the C isotopic systematics .
(variability, has been suggested in, process)

This view contrasts however with vanadium-scandium systematics (e.g. ), which do not highlight any significant secular change in mantle oxygen fugacity.

Key aspects of these models require better understanding: 1) the temporal evolution of the lithospheric mantle redox state, 2) the mechanism of diamond formation via interaction of melt and C-O-H fluid with mantle wall rocks, and 3) the origin of the proposed metasomatic fluids—are there local sources of carbon that are remobilized over centimeters, or fluids streaming through the lithosphere on kilometer scale-lengths?
(Key aspects of models, require, understanding)

Age systematics and isotopic compositions.

Currently, it is not possible to date monocrystalline diamonds by direct analysis of the diamond crystal.

Fibrous diamonds, being related to the kimberlite magmatism, have an age very close to that of kimberlite.
(diamonds being related to kimberlite magmatism, have, age)

But with only poorly aggregated nitrogen, the exact residence time (myr time scales) and temperature in the mantle remains unclear.
(residence time, remains, unclear)
(temperature, remains, unclear)

As such, all viable ages produced so far have been obtained by the analysis of solid inclusions within diamonds that are assumed to be syngenetic (see above) with the diamonds; the reader is directed to the isotopic age dating review of  for more details.
(ages produced, have been obtained by, analysis of inclusions within diamonds)
(reader, is directed to, age)

The first dating studies were performed on sulfide  and silicate  inclusions and indicated the likely antiquity of the host diamonds.
(studies, were performed on, sulfide inclusions)
(studies, indicated, antiquity of host diamonds)

Both these groundbreaking studies were made by pooling together numerous (sometimes >100) inclusions because of analytical constraints.
(studies, were made by, pooling inclusions)

Subsequently, the Sm-Nd isotope system became the method of choice and yielded a number of isochron ages from suites of diamonds from southern Africa (  1999, 2004), Siberia , and Western Australia .
(isotope system, became method of, choice)
(isotope system, yielded, number of isochron ages)

Some studies have questioned the validity of ages obtained on composites of inclusions (see discussion in ) and this uncertainty drove the need to make analyses on single inclusions.
(studies, have questioned, validity of ages obtained on composites of inclusions)

The Ar-Ar method was the first to be applied to single clinopyroxene inclusions in diamonds  because eclogitic omphacite contains sufficient potassium to allow age determinations.
(method, was first to be applied to, clinopyroxene inclusions)
(omphacite, contains, potassium)

It soon became clear that un-exposed, pristine inclusions are essential for this approach due to potential diffusion of radiogenic Ar to the silicate-diamond interface, yielding ages that range upwards from the kimberlite eruption age in cleaved diamonds .
(inclusions, are essential for, approach)

Because of the potential for incorporation of the locally abundant ambient 40Ar in the mantle (e.g., ), the ages can be viewed as absolute maxima for encapsulation of the inclusion by the diamond.
(ages, can be viewed as, maxima for encapsulation of inclusion by diamond)

Orapa eclogitic pyroxenes analyzed by  gave ages of 906 to 1032 Ma, consistent with previously determined Sm-Nd ages, with a few samples yielding ages >2500 Ma, hinting at the presence of multiple diamond age populations in this kimberlite.

These authors also found ages of 520 Ma for eclogitic omphacites from the Venetia kimberlite, indicating a population of diamonds that formed shortly before kimberlite eruption.
(authors, found, ages of Ma)

In summary, Ar-Ar geochronology studies of eclogitic pyroxenes from southern Africa largely confirm the results of the Sm-Nd approach, indicating E-type diamond formation from the Neoarchean onwards.
(geochronology studies of pyroxenes from Africa, confirm, results of approach)

Analysis of single inclusions in diamond has been most effectively realized using the Re-Os isotope system in sulfides.
(Analysis of inclusions, has been realized using, isotope system)

The relatively high Re and Os contents of sulfides from both E- and P-type parageneses, allow analyses of Os in the sub-picogram to nanogram range ( 1999b; ).
(Re, allow, analyses of Os)
(Os contents, allow, analyses of Os)
(parageneses, allow, analyses of Os)

The focus on obtaining relatively large sulfides for analysis has lead to an apparent bias towards dating studies involving E-type diamonds (e.g.,   2004;  2004b; ) although P-type sulfide inclusions have been analyzed in some instances ( 1999b;   ).
(focus on obtaining sulfides, has lead to, bias towards dating studies involving diamonds)
(sulfide inclusions, have been analyzed in, instances)

The general picture of lithospheric diamond formation revealed by Re-Os dating is that there are multiple diamond ages within one kimberlite (e.g.,   ) and that all E-type sulfide-bearing diamonds analyzed so far appear to have formed in the Neoarchean and later (   2004;  2008;  2009b;  ).

In contrast, diamonds containing P-type sulfides are older, having started to form from the Mesoarchean onwards ( 1999b;    ), with the exception of a single Mesozoic diamond from Koffiefontein  and one from Jagersfontein .

In addition to these “mainstream” approaches, there has been a small number of studies using the U-Pb system on zircon  and yimengite .

also made Ar-Ar age determinations on yimengite inclusions in a diamonds from the Sese kimberlite, Zimbabwe, producing apparent ages from 538 to 892 Ma.

These studies yielded relatively young formation ages.
(studies, yielded, formation ages)

Such phases that may be related to the proto-kimberlite melts, and are part of a growing body of evidence, augmented by Re-Os isotopes , Sm-Nd and Ar-Ar studies in E-type clinopyroxenes  and N-aggregation systematics, that indicate a proportion of gem diamond growth shortly before kimberlite eruption.
(phases, are, part of body of evidence)
(that, indicate, proportion of gem diamond growth)

So far only 2 age determinations have been made on ultra-deep, sub-lithospheric diamonds.

made a U-Pb ion probe determination of a Ca-silicate perovskite (re-equilibrated to walstromite) diamond inclusion from the Collier-4 kimberlite, Brazil that yielded an age of 107 ± 7 Ma, only 14 Ma older than the pipe emplacement age of 93 Ma.
(that, yielded, age of Ma)

This study did not use matrix-matched standards and, as such, the date must be viewed as preliminary.
(study, did not use, standards)
(study, must be viewed as, preliminary)
(date, must be viewed as, preliminary)

However, the results are supported by nitrogen aggregation data for super deep diamonds from this pipe, which imply, for an assumed temperature of ~1500 oC, a maximum mantle residence time of <10 Ma .
(results, are supported by, nitrogen aggregation data for diamonds from pipe)

In contrast, a single sulfide inclusion in an ultra-deep diamond from Juina examined by  indicated a formation age likely to be significantly in excess of 500 Ma, considerably older than the circa 90-Ma pipe emplacement age.

This sort of age (400 to 800 Ma) is seen for some radiogenic isotopic systems (e.g., Sm-Nd, Lu-Hf) in oceanic basalts and abyssal peridotites and thus is consistent with this diamond having grown deep in the convecting oceanic mantle.
(sort of age, is seen for, systems)

A similar conclusion can be drawn from the Sr and Nd isotopic compositions reported in majoritic garnet inclusions in diamonds from the mantle transition zone, also from the Brazilian craton (Sao Luis), which plot in the middle of the oceanic Sr and Nd isotopic array and distinctly different from the garnet inclusions from lithospheric diamonds .
(conclusion, can be drawn from, Sr reported in garnet inclusions in diamonds)

The scarcity of data from sulfides in ultra-deep diamonds has so far restricted age information on ultra-deep diamonds and this is certainly an area that will see more effort in the future.
(scarcity of data from sulfides in diamonds, has, age information on diamonds)
(scarcity of data from sulfides in diamonds, is, area)

Stable isotopic signatures in diamond inclusions.

The origin of diamond can also be addressed from the study of O- and S-isotopes in silicate and sulfide inclusions (n < 20 and n < 50, respectively).
(origin of diamond, can be addressed from, study of O)

Although fairly limited data are available, both provide evidence for the involvement of subduction-related material.

The 18O/16O-isotope variability (δ18O from +4 to +16‰) of eclogitic diamond inclusions, contrasts with the mantle homogeneity displayed by peridotite xenoliths and diamond inclusions and only compare with the known range measured in altered ocean crust (see   ).
(variability, contrasts with, mantle homogeneity displayed by peridotite xenoliths)
(variability, compare with, range measured in ocean crust)

Although often equilibrated at lower pressure and temperature, eclogite xenoliths have O-isotope compositions consistent with those in eclogitic diamond inclusions (see  for review).
(xenoliths, have, compositions)

Eclogitic sulfide inclusions also display variable 34S/32S ratios (δ34S from –11 to +14‰) that compare well with sediments and altered oceanic crust, but it must be emphasized that the most recent studies did not reproduce such a large range of values (  and references therein).
(sulfide inclusions, display, ratios)
(studies, did not reproduce, range of values)

Unambiguous evidence for the involvement of subduction-related sulfur in eclogitic diamond inclusions is brought from the recognition of mass-independent fractionations of sulfur isotopes (i.e., δ33S ≠ 0.5 × δ34S) within sulfide diamond inclusions (Fig. 16;  ).
The only known geologically relevant process to be associated with sulfur isotopic compositions with mass-independant fractionations is the UV-photolysis of sulfur-bearing molecules in an O2-deprived composition: on Earth, such conditions were met during the Archean Eon .
(conditions, were met during, Archean Eon)

Therefore the identification of mass-independent fractionations of sulfur isotopes within sulfides eclogitic diamond inclusions , and their absence within peridotitic diamonds , demonstrate the occurrence of recycled Archean sedimentary sulfur in the former.
(identification of fractionations of sulfur isotopes, demonstrate, occurrence of Archean sulfur)

GEOLOGY OF MANTLE CARBON FROM DIAMONDS

Geodynamics, Carbon Mobility and Reservoirs

Diamond–the mechanisms by which it crystallizes, the relationship it bears to the explosive kimberlite host magmas that deliver it, and the distribution of different diamond types in a geologic context–provide the key to understanding the carbon cycle in the deep mantle.
(Diamond, provide, key)

Continent assembly, plate tectonics, and ancient carbon recycling.

As a consequence of old cratons having preserved mantle keels, the diamond record remains one of the prime ways to examine continental tectonics from mantle depths and avoid the later overprinting effects of metasomatism.

It also is the only way to get some idea of Earth’s ancient igneous carbon cycle.

extended the observations of isotopic ages to all diamond formation ages so far determined and combined it with the diamond type to show that only P-type diamonds were forming in the lithosphere during the Paleoarchean to Mesoarchean, whereas E-type diamonds began to form post-3Ga and became the prevalent type of diamond formed (Fig. 17).
(diamonds, were forming in, lithosphere)

These authors went on to propose, based on the diamond inclusion geochronology database that includes both the Sm-Nd data on silicate inclusions and the Re-Os data on sulfides, that continental dispersion and subduction tectonics as we know it in the modern Earth—the Wilson cycle—initiated in the Neoarchean.
(authors, went on, to propose)

The transition to an Earth dominated by lateral tectonics and subduction is not well explained at the present time, but the 3-Ga shift to eclogitic inclusions does correlate with a major change in crustal geologic style (Van  2011) and crustal growth mechanisms , which do support the Wilson Cycle onset conclusion.
(shift to inclusions, does correlate with, change in style)
(transition to Earth dominated by tectonics, is not explained at, time)

We do not know, for example, whether the appearance of eclogite simply signals a more effective capture of slabs by a buoyant keel in which they can be retained or the actual appearance of large slabs in the geologic record.
(appearance of eclogite, signals, capture of slabs)

If it is the latter, this change may have important implications for the nature of carbon-bearing fluids and their delivery to diamond-forming depths in the mantle.
(change, may have, implications for nature of fluids)

Using subtle trends in the carbon isotopic composition of P-Type diamonds,  proposed that there may a change in the mechanism by which older diamonds form from methane oxidation in the Mesoarchean Era to the way that younger diamonds form by carbonate reduction in the Proterozoic Eon.
(diamonds, form from, methane oxidation in Mesoarchean Era)
(diamonds, form by, carbonate reduction in Proterozoic Eon)

If this observation is combined with the proposed onset of the Wilson Cycle, it could signify a change from the geodynamic processes that would favor primary mantle devolatilization and/or the outgassing of recycled reduced fluids, to the geodynamic processes that favor carbonate recycling via slab subduction.
(observation, is combined with, onset of Wilson Cycle)

Diamond inclusion populations and ages have also been linked to broad-scale regional lithosphere evolution.
(Diamond inclusion populations, have been linked to, lithosphere evolution)
(ages, have been linked to, lithosphere evolution)

A number of authors have made the link between diamond formation events or pulses and large-scale thermo-tectonic events recorded in the craton crust ( 2004b;     2009b).
(number of authors, have made, link between diamond formation events)

Shirey et al.

(2002, 2004a, 2004b) have noted that in southern Africa, mantle lithosphere with slower seismic P-wave velocity relative to the craton average correlates with a greater proportion of E-type versus P-type silicate inclusions in diamonds, a greater incidence of younger (Mesoproterozoic Era) Sm-Nd inclusion ages, a greater proportion of diamonds with light C-isotope compositions and a lower proportion of low-N diamonds (Fig. 18).
(mantle lithosphere with velocity, correlates with, proportion of silicate inclusions in diamonds)

This correlation was proposed to result from Proterozoic modification of Mesoarchean lithosphere by large-scale tectono-magmatic events in the Proterozoic Eon, which added new lherzolitic and eclogitic diamonds to an original harzburgitic inventory of diamonds.
(correlation, was proposed to result from, modification of lithosphere)

In this case, diamond-forming fluids equilibrated with pre-existing silicates and incorporated them as inclusions, retaining the mineralogical differences imparted by the sub-lithospheric magmatism of the Bushveld Complex, now retained as fossil seismic velocity differences (Fig. 18).
(fluids equilibrated with silicates retaining differences imparted by magmatism of Bushveld Complex, retained as, velocity differences)
(incorporated, retained as, velocity differences)

The craton-wide pattern for southern Africa displayed by sulfide-bearing diamonds is different than the pattern seen with silicate-bearing diamonds.
(pattern for Africa displayed by diamonds, is different than, pattern seen with diamonds)

This difference stems from the close association of the sulfide-bearing diamonds with sulfide-containing eclogite that is the source of the diamond fluids and the occurrence of sulfides in different diamonds than those that contain silicate inclusions.
(difference, stems from, association of diamonds)

The Kaapvaal craton was assembled from two independent continental blocks after 2.97 Ga .
(craton, was assembled from, blocks)

Westward-facing subduction underneath the western or “Kimberley” block  effectively made the western block the hanging wall for the fluids and sulfur carried by the oceanic slab (e.g., ) and the western cratonic keel the recipient of any eclogite that could be incorporated.

The surface distribution of diamond ages and types is a result of this process.
(surface distribution of diamond ages, is, result of process)

West of the suture, all diamond mines contain 2.9 Ga diamonds whereas east of the suture 2.9 Ga diamonds are absent (Fig. 19).
(West of suture, contain, Ga diamonds)

If younger ages occur it is either where the lithosphere was subject to subduction at its margin or where persistent, pervasive sub-lithospheric magmatism took place (e.g., Bushveld complex; Fig. 19).
(lithosphere, was subject to, subduction at margin)
(magmatism, took, place)

The systematic relationship of diamond age and type to the geologic processes that have affected the deepest parts of the continental lithosphere, besides being an excellent exploration model, makes diamond formation a premier tracer of the passage of ancient carbon-rich fluids.
(relationship of diamond age, makes tracer of, passage of fluids)

Lithospheric diamonds are old, typically 1.0 to 3.5 Ga, and apparently crystallized during and after lithosphere construction.
(diamonds, crystallized during, lithosphere construction)

Both primordial mantle carbon and carbon sourced from subducted lithosphere could have participated in diamond-forming events in the lithosphere as a consequence of fluid and melt metasomatism.
(mantle carbon, sourced from, lithosphere)
(carbon, sourced from, lithosphere)

The thermodynamic and experimental observations described above are permissive of a large number of pathways for diamond crystallization, and from a wide compositional range of fluids, melts, and solids (Fig. 20a, b; see section on Diamond Formation).
(observations described, are permissive of, number of pathways for diamond crystallization)

The considerable compositional range of mineral and fluid inclusions found in diamonds likely attests to many of these pathways being important in nature.
(range of mineral inclusions found in diamonds, attests to, important in nature)

What is clear from a mantle redox point of view is that diamond crystallization from fluids and melts in mantle lithosphere is an explicable and expected outcome of mantle metasomatism.

Deep carbon cycling with mantle convection: sub-lithospheric diamonds.

has suggested a link between the depth intervals over which sub-lithospheric inclusions most commonly occur (e.g. Table 2) based on barometric evidence, and dehydration of hydrous or nominally anhydrous minerals in subducting lithospheric slabs, and postulated a depth control by the location of fluid or melt occurrence.

Harte suggests that dehydration of lawsonite in subducted mafic rocks provides a location for melt formation and the inclusion of the shallower (~300 km) majoritic inclusions, whereas deeper majoritic inclusions from the transition zone may occur as a consequence of dehydration melting at the wadsleyite-to-olivine transformation and the deepest diamonds possibly related to dehydration of hydrous ringwoodite and dense hydrous Mg-silicates formed in subducted peridotites.
(dehydration of lawsonite, provides, location for melt formation)
(inclusions from transition zone, may occur as, consequence of dehydration melting at transformation)

A link between subducted protoliths and sub-lithospheric diamonds is strong in many cases.
(link between protoliths, is strong in, cases)

For example, Tappert et al.

(2005a, 2005b) showed that majorite garnets from Jagersfontein have Eu anomalies linking them to subducted oceanic crust, while the diamond hosts have extremely negative carbon isotope compositions possibly derived from a subducted carbon source.
(garnets from Jagersfontein, have, Eu anomalies linking them)
(diamond hosts, have, carbon isotope compositions derived from carbon source)

These authors postulate diamond formation by direct conversion from graphite in a subducted slab.
(authors, postulate, diamond formation by conversion from graphite)

Many sub-lithospheric inclusions in natural diamonds provide ample evidence for the role of deep melts in their origin.
(inclusions in diamonds, provide, evidence for role of deep)

Phase relations and abundances of incompatible trace elements show that effectively all reported inclusions in diamond interpreted as relic Ca-rich perovskite likely crystallized directly from melts derived from low extents of melting .
(inclusions in diamond, interpreted as, perovskite)

The majority of majoritic garnet inclusions in sub-lithospheric diamonds could also have crystallized in equilibrium with low-degree, carbonate-rich melts .

and  argue for a model involving diamond and inclusion co-precipitation from low-extent, carbonate-rich melts.

These melts are envisioned to have originated within subducted oceanic lithosphere that became stranded in the deep transition zone or shallow lower mantle and thermalized with ambient mantle (Fig. 20b).
(melts, are envisioned to originated within, lithosphere)

Under such conditions, carbonated slab materials, including sediment, basalt, and peridotite, would potentially release low-degree, carbonate-rich melts, possibly hydrous, into the surrounding mantle.

As illustrated in Figure 20b, the oxidized, carbonate-rich melts would be unstable in the ambient, reducing mantle, and when the highly mobile melts infiltrate the surrounding mantle, reaction with the mantle and reduction of carbonate results in diamond precipitation by “redox freezing” .
(melts, would be unstable in, ambient)
(mantle, results in, diamond precipitation)

A feature of some inclusions in super-deep diamonds is unmixing of originally homogeneous phases into a composite of two or more phases (Table 2).
(feature of inclusions in diamonds, is unmixing of, phases)

Unmixing is common in majorite inclusions , occurs in Ti-rich Ca-perovskite , and  have argued that a suite of unmixed inclusions from Juina, Brazil, represents original Al-rich Mg-perovskite, CF-phase, and NAL-phase that formed in the lower mantle (Table 2).
(Unmixing, is common in, inclusions)

These observations indicate that the diamonds were transported upward by as much as hundreds of kilometers from their place of origin prior to incorporation into kimberlite magmas.

The mechanism for upwelling beneath a craton is unclear, but could be related to a deep-seated mantle plume in the case of the sub-lithospheric mantle beneath Brazil (e.g.,  ).

Mantle that has undergone metasomatism and diamond formation via redox freezing would be locally more carbon-rich and more oxidizing than ambient mantle.

Upon upwelling of such metasomatized mantle, carbonate will become stabilized at a depth that will depend on the carbon content and the ambient fO2.
(carbonate, will become, stabilized at depth)

If this stabilization occurs, local oxidation of diamond to carbonate will drastically lower the solidus, resulting in “redox melting” (Fig. 20b;   ).
(oxidation of diamond, will lower, solidus)

Newly formed carbonated melts would then inject into more reducing mantle, and redox freezing could again occur.

This process of repeated redox freezing, including melting, may in part explain the complex textures observed in many super-deep diamonds that include multiple growth centers, resorption and re-growth, and intense and complex zoning (Fig. 1, bottom).
(process of redox freezing, may explain, textures observed in diamonds)

Diamonds from the transition zone (Fig. 7) cover a large range in 13C/12C ratio, yet display restricted and distinct ranges from one locality to another.
(Diamonds from transition zone, cover, range in 13C/12C ratio)

For example, Kankan transition zone diamonds have higher 13C/12C (δ13C ~1‰), whereas those from Jagerfontain are much lower 13C/12C (δ13C ~ -20‰; Fig. 7).
(transition zone diamonds, have, 13C/12C)

As these diamonds are eclogitic in nature, it remains unknown whether these values are characteristic of larger transition zone domains or only apply to local eclogitic regions.
(diamonds, are eclogitic in, nature)
(values, are characteristic of, transition zone domains)
(values, apply to, regions)

The link between diamond formation in the transition zone and the subduction factory has been emphasized by the unique C-isotope characteristics of the diamonds and the trace element patterns their included eclogitic garnets (e.g., ), and is essential for the “redox-freezing” model for super-deep diamond growth (see above).
(link between diamond formation in transition zone, has been emphasized by, characteristics of diamonds)

N-isotope geochemistry of most studied transition zone diamonds also support the subduction-factory link , although this link has been challenging to confirm with 15N/14N studies because of the preponderance sub-lithospheric diamonds that are Type-II (nitrogen-free).
(geochemistry of transition zone diamonds, support, link)
(link, has challenging to confirm with, 15N/14N studies)

Low 13C/12C compositions are rarer in the studied lower mantle diamond population (Fig. 7; ), which might suggest eclogitic material rarely reaches the lower mantle.
(material, reaches, mantle)

Recently, though, a suite of low 13C/12C (δ13C ~ –24‰) lower mantle diamonds containing a high-pressure basaltic mineral assemblage was studied, confirming that recycling can reach the lower mantle .
(recycling, can reach, mantle)

In general, the complex growth pattern of super-deep diamonds identified by cathodoluminescence (Fig. 1;  in press) is substantiated by C-isotope heterogeneity, illustrating multiple diamond growth events in a changing P-T environment (e.g.,  ).
(growth pattern of diamonds identified by cathodoluminescence, is substantiated by, heterogeneity)

Carbon mobility with melt: the diamond-kimberlite-carbonatite connection.

With the exception of rare lamproite and lamprophyre, lithospheric and sub-lithospheric diamonds have been transported to the surface exclusively in rocks of kimberlitic composition (e.g., ).

Experimental studies and igneous petrology establish a petrogenetic link between kimberlite, carbonatite, and carbonated peridotite .
(studies, establish, link between kimberlite)
(petrology, establish, link between kimberlite)

Where kimberlites originate and how they form are matters beyond simple diamond transport, for, although nearly all monocrystalline diamonds are much older (e.g., many tens of millions to billions of years older) than their host kimberlite, there is much that the study of kimberlites can contribute to understanding deep mantle fluids and melts in the region of diamond growth.
(study of kimberlites, can contribute to, understanding)

Kimberlites are rare but have been found on every continent and are associated with cratonic portion that has mantle lithospheric keel.
(Kimberlites, are associated with, portion)

Kimberlites are well known to have erupted more commonly in the Phanerozoic Eon than in the Pre-Cambrian .

The number of known kimberlite occurrences older than 1 Ga is fairly small, and although at the moment Archean kimberlites are not known, the presence of alluvial macro-diamonds in late Archean sediments indicates that such ancient kimberlites may indeed have existed (e.g.,  ).

Apparently the number of kimberlites that erupted globally increased dramatically around the Phanerozoic Eon (e.g.,  ), although Tertiary kimberlites are much less abundant and only one Quaternary example has been reported .

Most kimberlites are not diamond bearing, but those that are must have originated at least as deep as the onset of diamond stability, which is at ~140 km, a depth that is consistent with results from thermobarometry on mantle xenoliths in kimberlites.
(kimberlites, are, diamond bearing)

The presence of sub-lithospheric diamonds in some kimberlites places kimberlite magma generation within the asthenosphere or deeper in the mantle, at least for these kimberlite pipes.

The isotopic composition and mineralogy of Group I kimberlites also supports a sub-lithospheric origin, whereas the lithospheric affinity of Group II raises question of a shallower source that may be in the lithosphere for these kimberlites.
(composition, supports, origin)
(mineralogy, supports, origin)
(kimberlites, supports, origin)
(affinity of Group II, raises, question of source)

Kimberlite magmas collect and transport a tremendous amount and variety of foreign material, including xenoliths and xenocrysts derived from both mantle and crustal sources.
(magmas, transport, amount variety)

For this reason, establishing the bulk composition of primary kimberlite magma has long been problematic (e.g., ).

However, from rare hypabyssal aphanitic examples and from chemical re-constructions, a general consensus has emerged that kimberlites are silica-understaurated (~15 to 35 wt% SiO2) and MgO-rich (~20 to 35 wt%), and contain a high volatile component, possibly rich in both carbon (~5 to 20 wt%) and water (~5 to 10 wt%; see  ).

The lack of knowledge of the composition of primary kimberlite magma renders petrogenetic models for their origin non-unique.
(lack of knowledge of composition of kimberlite magma, renders, models)

For example, their elemental enrichments and volatile-rich nature might indicate either very low-degree partial melting of cryptically metasomatized mantle ( Becker and Le ) or higher-degree melting of pervasively veined mantle ( 2004).
(enrichments, might indicate, melting of mantle)
(nature, might indicate, melting of mantle)

Kimberlites also bear resemblance to carbonatitic rocks in terms of their high degree of silica undersaturation and enrichments in incompatible elements and volatiles, and for this reason there is a possible petrogenetic link between these magma types.
(Kimberlites, bear, resemblance to rocks)

On the basis of experimental melting phase relations of model carbonated peridotite, there is a continuum of compositions ranging from carbonatitic magmas (e.g., SiO2 < 5 wt%) at the solidus to compositions akin to kimberlites at higher degrees of melting  at pressures at least up to up to 8 GPa.

With this link to carbonatites, kimberlites themselves then would provide information about the carbon cycle by being generated from deep carbonatitic sources.

Another possible link is that carbonatitic melts may have been responsible for the metasomatic conditioning of the mantle source regions from which kimberlites form.

Carbonatitic melts are probably highly mobile in the mantle  and are considered to be very effective metasomatic agents , influencing the mantle either chemically or modally.

Melting of carbonate-metasomatized mantle, especially in the presence of water, may produce primary kimberlite magmas.

Recently a model was developed whereby kimberlites form as the product of reaction of proto-carbonatitic melts with orthopyroxene-bearing mantle peridotite (Fig. 21).
(product of reaction, melts with, mantle peridotite)

Dissolution of orthopyroxene into carbonatite increases the silica content, which at the same time decreases the solubility of volatiles (i.e., CO2 and H2O).
(Dissolution of orthopyroxene, increases, silica content)

Exsolution of the volatile phase provides buoyancy for the magma and a mechanism for rapid upward migration and incorporation of xenolithic material.
(Exsolution of phase, provides, buoyancy)

Continued dissolution of orthopyroxene as the magma rises eventually changes the carbonatitic primary magma into a kimberlitic magma, and the progressively decreasing volatile solubility eventually leads to the rapid and explosive transport and emplacement of diamonds from the deep mantle to the shallow crust or surface (Fig. 21).
(magma, rises, changes leads to transport)
(solubility, leads to, transport)

Carbon reservoirs: primordial versus recycled carbon.

Carbon is a massively cycled element and it is likely that it is close to steady state in Earth’s mantle (e.g.,  ).
(Carbon, is, element)

In other words, the central question is not whether carbon is subducted but rather whether we can record the isotope heterogeneity introduced in Earth’s mantle by subduction and distinguish it from the heterogeneity induced by intra-mantle processes (e.g., metasomatism), or even by mixing with a homogeneous (or heterogeneous) C-isotopic reservoir.

Furthermore, with mantle carbon having a long residence time, ca.
(mantle carbon, having, residence time)

4-6 Gy and other isotopic evidence for long-lived ancient mantle reservoirs (e.g.,  ), it is possible that a primordial C-reservoir might still exist and be sampled.

The occurrence of low δ13C in diamonds has been often ascribed to reflect a primordial heterogeneity of carbon in the mantle ( 1993; ) although this model, among others, fails to account for their occurrence among eclogitic rather than in peridotitic diamonds.
(model, fails to account for, occurrence among eclogitic)
(occurrence of d13C in diamonds, has been ascribed to reflect, heterogeneity of carbon)

The argument according to which mantle carbon might be isotopically heterogeneous was originally based on the similarities between the δ13C distribution of carbon in iron meteorites and diamonds but how such heterogeneities could survive mantle convection and homogenization during a period of magma ocean remained unaddressed.
(argument according to, remained, unaddressed)
(heterogeneities, could survive, mantle convection homogenization)

In a model in which carbon is at steady state, it is anticipated that Earth’s convective mantle (i.e., the reservoir from which the oceanic and continental crust are extracted and subducted ocean crust is recycled) and the primordial reservoir would have similar δ13C close to –5‰.
(carbon, is at, state)
(reservoir, would have, d13C close)
(reservoir, would have, d13C close)

This similarity would also be the case for carbon exchanged between the surface and the mantle; degassed carbon and recycled carbon would display time-integreated δ13C close to –5‰.
(similarity, be, case for carbon exchanged between surface)
(carbon, would display, d13C close)
(carbon, would display, d13C close)

In this context, the fact that ocean island basalts, mid-ocean ridge basalts, carbonatites, kimberlite, and diamonds have a δ13C mode close to –5‰ is not inconsistent whatever the source of their carbon.
(ocean island basalts, have, d13C mode)

The evidence for primordial carbon is therefore typically inferred from other systematics such as rare gases in ocean island basalts, but the respective contributions of carbon from the primordial and convective reservoirs remain to be established as their concentration in the primordial reservoir remains unknown.
(concentration in reservoir, remains, unknown)
(evidence for carbon, is inferred from, systematics)

Additional evidence for primordial heterogeneity in diamonds has been suggested from three samples displaying low δ15N-values (< –25‰).
(evidence for heterogeneity in diamonds, has been suggested from, samples displaying)

In this case the δ13C-value close to  –3.5 ‰ was suggested  but the size of the primordial reservoir and its carbon concentration cannot be addressed.

Several diamond populations (from lamprophyre in French Guyana and from Jericho kimberlite in Northern Slave with δ13C-modes ~–28 ‰ and –38‰ respectively) are unique and difficult to interpret in the light of heterogeneity being either primordial, subducted, or mantle-related.

This difficulty arises because there is almost no sediment with δ13C as low as –40‰.

Their preservation of such low δ13C further requires the virtual absence of any (i.e., 13C-enriched) carbonates, which is not consistent with observations in metamorphic rocks and sediments in general.
(preservation of d13C, requires, absence of carbonates)

Those odd C-isotope distributions might alternatively reflect an as yet unknown process(es), but we lack appropriate experimental work to investigate such a possibility.
(distributions, might reflect, process)

Overall, the data suggest that the existence of a primordial carbon reservoir can be recognized and sampled from the study of diamonds, but its existence can only be established in the light of additional tracers (trace elements, radiogenic and other stable isotope systematics).
(existence of carbon reservoir, sampled from, study of diamonds)
(existence, can be established in, light of tracers)

Although usually at sub-ppm or ppb levels, diamonds contain many impurities that can be used in future studies to perhaps resolve  the many open issues that have been highlighted in this review chapter.
(diamonds, contain, impurities)

OUTSTANDING QUESTIONS AND FUTURE WORK

The comprehensive, cross-disciplinary nature of this review identifies some of the areas where important unknowns in diamond research can be addressed with future work: 1) the quantitative partitioning of elements and fractionation of isotopes during diamond growth; 2) the co-genetic (or not) relationship of diamond to its host inclusions and the age of diamonds; 3) the recognition and significance of primordial carbon, primary mantle carbon, or subducted carbon in the composition of diamond; 4) the speciation of C in diamond-forming fluids and the processes that control the oxygen fugacity of the mantle; 5) the deepest diamonds, their ultra-high pressure inclusions and the geodynamic processes occurring in convecting the mantle; 6) the experimental simulation of diamond formation from a variety of mantle fluids and melts; and 7) the nanostructural characteristics of diamond as they relate to all aspects of diamond formation.
(nature of review, identifies, some of areas)
(unknowns in diamond research, can be addressed with, work)

The expected answers to questions in these areas will lead to a new understanding of the conditions of diamond formation in the deep mantle, how diamond-forming and diamond-carrying melts interact with mantle peridotite, whether a significant reservoir of mantle carbon is primordial or recycled, and how carbon is transported and stored in the mantle now and in the past (up to 3.5 billion years ago).
(answers to questions in areas, will lead to, understanding of conditions of diamond formation)

Such integrated research on natural diamond has the potential to transform our knowledge about the sources of the surface volcanic flux of carbon, the connections between carbon in the biosphere to carbon in the deep mantle, the behavior of carbon in Earth’s interior under extreme conditions, and the geodynamics of Earth’s mantle.

Initial development of the enriched reservoir, at t1, requires early separation of the enriched source from either a chondritic or depleted mantle reservoir sometime in the Archean (as required by elevated 207Pb/204Pb at modest 206Pb/204Pb).
(development of reservoir, requires, separation of source)

A spectrum of incompatible element enrichment was generated at this time, leading to a wide range in Nd isotope compositions over 2 to 3 Ga in time.

The rationale in using the 15N/14N-values in diamonds lies in the distinct distributions displayed by surface and mantle reservoirs.

Nitrogen in metasedimentary and metamorphic diamonds, metagabbros and metaophioloites (not shown) being enriched in 15N compared to the mantle shown here by fibrous/coated diamond, mid-ocean ridge basalts (not shown) and peridotitic diamonds.

The similarities of the 15N/14N-distributions of eclogitic and peridotitic diamonds must be explained if the source of carbon and nitrogen in eclogitic diamond is to be largely related to subduction (see text for discussion).

P–T estimates for eclogitic xenoliths and touching Grt–Cpx pairs included in eclogitic diamonds using a combination of the Fe–Mg exchange thermometer (K00; Krogh ) with two different versions of the Grt–Cpx barometer (ST00:  Si08: ).
(Cpx pairs, included in, diamonds)

Both combinations produce a substantial overlap of diamond-bearing and graphite-bearing eclogites, a significant proportion of diamond-bearing samples in the graphite stability field, and variable proportions of excessive T and P values (much greater than expected for majorite-poor garnets), suggesting poor reliability of eclogite thermobarometry.

The scatter is considerably reduced if one excludes diopsides with aCr < 0.005, for which P estimates can be severely in error (see text for further explanation).

Inclusions in websteritic diamonds containing also non-touching Opx inclusions are indicated with crossed-symbols.

REE in peridotitic and eclogitic garnet inclusions from the database of  and normalized to C1-chondrite .

The top diagram shows the compositional fields and average compositions of harzburgitic and lherzolitic garnets.
(diagram, shows, fields compositions)

The average composition of lherzolitic garnets from Birim diamonds (Akwatia, Ghana; Fig. 3) is shown to represent “normal” REE patterns generally (but not exclusively) restricted to the lherzolitic paragenesis.

The strongly sinusoidal REE patterns typically observed for the harzburgitic paragenesis represent depleted garnets that have been re-enriched in  light REE.

This pattern requires a metasomatic agent with extremely high light REE to heavy REE, believed to indicate fluid metasomatism.

Mineral inclusions in sublithospheric diamonds and their associated parageneses [modified from  and references therein, with additions].

The indicative mineral assemblages of the depth zones of sublithospheric inclusions in diamond are never seen due to exsolution and transformations to low-pressure phases as indicated.

Furthermore, the rarity of these inclusions and their small size means that, in most cases, crystal structure is inferred from elemental composition.
(crystal structure, is inferred from, composition)

Therefore, the depth ranges of these diamonds with inclusions are approximate because they are derived from the principal mineral inclusions observed in the diamond at low pressure.
