In sharp contrast to the pancellular distribution of Mirk in cycling myoblasts, a dramatic shift in the localization of Mirk to a solely cytoplasmic location was seen in differentiating G1-arrested myotubes within 2 days of shift to differentiation medium.

Carbon has the ability to tie to itself and to more than 80 other elements in a variety of bonding topologies, most commonly in 2-, 3-, and 4-coordination.

# be able to

It is certainly possible that the mTORC2-mediated phosphorylation events on DUSP10 or additional post-translational modifications are able to regulate substrate specificity.

Duplicate cultures of C2C12 myoblasts were cultured in differentiation medium for 1 day before partition into nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions and analysis of Mirk protein localization by western blotting.

Mirk acts to promote the survival of differentiating myoblasts, at least in part, by phosphorylating the CDK inhibitor p21, causing p21 to accumulate in the cytoplasm where it functions as an anti-apoptotic signaling molecule.

Mirk becomes restricted to the cytoplasm during myogenesis.

Carbides, along with diamond, may not thus represent Earthâ€™s deepest surviving minerals, and may prove a relatively unexplored window on the nature of the deep mantle environment and the deep carbon cycle.

# predicate conjunction

Carbon, element 6, displays remarkable chemical flexibility and thus is unique in the diversity of its mineralogical roles.

With oxidation numbers ranging from -4 to +4, carbon is observed to behave as a cation, as an anion, and as a neutral species in phases with an astonishing range of crystal structures, chemical bonding, and physical and chemical properties.

This versatile element concentrates in dozens of different Earth repositories, from the atmosphere and oceans to the crust, mantle, and core, including solids, liquids, and gases as both a major and trace element .

The objective of this chapter is to review the mineralogy and crystal chemistry of carbon, with a focus primarily on phases in which carbon is an essential element: most notably the polymorphs of carbon, the carbides, and the carbonates.

Carbon, a non-metal that typically forms covalent bonds with a variety of other elements, is the most chemically adaptable element of the periodic table.

In an ionic sense, element 6 can act as a cation with oxidation number +4, as in carbon dioxide (CO2) or in the carbonate anion   (CO3-2).

However, while a correlation exists between the HER2 overexpression status in breast tumors and their sensitivity to HER2 inhibitors, such a correlation has failed to materialize in clinical trials involving EGFR inhibitors, leaving a gap in our understanding of tumor dependency on EGFR signaling.
